## 0. What this document is

This is a **self-extracting document**. It is, at once:

1. **A complete description** of the KAIF framework — its philosophy, structure, conventions, skills,
   lifecycle, spheres, and adapters.
2. **An installer.** Hand this single file to an AI agent and say *"unpack the KAIF framework into this
   project per FRAMEWORK.md"* — the agent reads it and writes out the entire structure (guidance docs,
   directory conventions, and slash-skills), customized to the project.

Everything the agent needs to recreate the framework is **inside this one document** — the templates are
embedded inline. You don't need anything else.

### The problem it solves

AI coding agents are powerful but suffer two chronic failures:

- **They forget.** Context is lost between sessions. Every new session starts from zero: re-discovering
  the architecture, the decisions, the half-finished work, the bug it was chasing yesterday.
- **They drift.** Left autonomous, an agent either stalls (over-engineering a misunderstood task) or
  oversteps (making brand/architecture decisions that weren't its to make).

KAIF fixes both by **externalizing the agent's working memory and discipline into the repository
itself** — as a small set of markdown files, directory conventions, and repeatable slash-skills. The
result: any fresh session resumes instantly with full context, works autonomously within clear bounds,
and accumulates knowledge instead of evaporating it.

It is not code. It is **process, captured as files an agent reads** — a methodology for the human–AI
tandem, in the spirit of Agile/Kanban/Scrum but for an AI executor. It works with any language, any
stack, **any domain** (not only programming — see §12 Spheres) and **any agent system** (see §13
Adapters), and it has a **lifecycle** (§11): versioned, updatable from origin, forkable, and respectfully
removable.

## 1. How to use this document

### If you are a human (the project owner)

1. Download `FRAMEWORK.md` into the root of your project (or clone this repository alongside it).
2. Open your AI coding agent in the project and tell it:
   > *"Read FRAMEWORK.md and unpack the KAIF framework into this project."*
3. The agent will inspect your project, create the structure, and fill in the project-specific details
   (build command, architecture, etc.). It will **ask your preferred working language** (default English)
   and may ask a few owner-level questions (brand, license) via a short interview document — answer them.
4. From then on, drive your agent with the skills: `/resume` to start a session, `/pause` to wrap up,
   `/autoloop` (or `/dayloop` / `/nightloop`) to grind the backlog autonomously, and the rest as needed.

See **§9 — For the human: quick start** for the full walkthrough.

### If you are an AI agent

1. Read this entire document.
2. Follow **§8 — Unpacking** step by step. Inspect the target project, then write out the structure
   from the templates embedded here, replacing every `<PLACEHOLDER>` with the project's real values.
3. Commit, and report to the human what you created and what still needs their input.

### 🌍 Localized deployment — the developer's working language

The framework's **sources are written in English** (the shared community language). But a team works best
reading its own project in its own language. So **deployment is localized**: when unpacking, the agent
**asks the owner for their preferred working language** (default: English) and writes the *deployed*
wrapper — the four guidance docs, the skills, and the `plans/`/`bugs/`/`interviews/` documents — in
that language. The framework unpacks *from its English sources into the developer's chosen language*.

- **Localize:** all prose, headings, list items, table text, and each skill's `description:` field
  (including its trigger phrases — so the agent matches commands in the owner's language).
- **Keep canonical (never translate):** code, shell commands, file paths, URLs, identifiers, the skills'
  `name:` field (the `/command` ids like `resume`, `pause`), and the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

> This repository is itself the living example: its public payload (`framework/`, `FRAMEWORK.md`) is
> English, while its own working wrapper is in **Russian** — the language its owner works in. Your
> deployment picks whatever language suits *you*.

### ⚠️ The fractal caveat — read this before unpacking

This framework is **dogfooded**: the repository you may be looking at (`KAIF`)
*uses the framework on itself*. Its own root contains an `AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `STATUS.md`, `.claude/skills/`,
`plans/`, `bugs/`, and `interviews/` — but those describe **the development of the framework itself**, not
your project.

> **When unpacking into a user's project, derive everything from THIS document (`FRAMEWORK.md`) only.**
> Do NOT copy the framework repository's own root `AGENT_GUIDE.md` / `STATUS.md` / etc. — they are the
> framework's self-application and are about building the framework, not about your project. The embedded
> templates in this document are the canonical, generic source. (This is the resolution of the recursion:
> the self-extracting document is the single source of truth for deployment.)

---

## 2. Philosophy — why this framework exists

**The human–AI compact: visionary + executor.** With capable agentic AI, the human steps out of the role
of hands-on implementer and into the role of **high-level visionary and fairway-keeper** — seeing the end
goal, the meaning, the shape of the result. The AI agent is the **executor**: fast, precise, tireless,
consistent — where humans err in details, forget, and lose the thread. AI, in turn, is weak at forming
high-level meaning and vision — exactly the human's strength. KAIF is the **interface between these two
nodes**: it binds human-visionary and AI-executor into one super-effective union and steers their work
toward the human's vision. Like Agile or Scrum for human teams, KAIF is a reusable methodology for the
human–AI tandem — so you don't re-teach the collaboration from scratch on every project; you deploy KAIF
and start.

Underneath that compact, four mechanisms hold it together:

**1. Externalized memory.** The agent's working state lives in files, not in the conversation. Four
documents carry it: `AGENT_GUIDE.md` (the canon — rules, map, commands), `STATUS.md` (the living state —
what's done, where we are, what's next), `PHILOSOPHY.md` (how to think), `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` (how to
debug). A new session reads these and is immediately productive. The agent **maintains them** as it works —
they are living documents, not write-once files.

**2. Knowledge that accumulates.** Bugs, decisions, and proposals don't vanish into chat history. Each
bug becomes a document in `bugs/` (symptom → forensics → root cause → fix). Each owner decision becomes an
`interviews/` document. Each agent idea becomes a `plans/ideas/` document. The repository becomes a
growing knowledge base about *how this project is built and why*.

**3. Bounded autonomy.** The agent is trusted to work alone for hours — but it knows exactly which
decisions are its own (anything cheap to reverse) and which belong to the human (brand, UX, architecture —
anything that shapes the product long-term). The latter are escalated through `interviews/`, not guessed.
The loop skills (`autoloop`/`dayloop`/`nightloop`) encode this: grind autonomously, escalate the
fateful, never go interactive when the human is away.

**4. Simplicity above cleverness.** The prime directive (`PHILOSOPHY.md`): if something is taking too
long, the task isn't hard — you misunderstood it and are over-complicating. Stuck = re-understand and
simplify, never escalate complexity. KISS + Occam's Razor, enforced by a hard 3-attempts rule before
switching from poking to research.

---

## 3. The structure at a glance

Unpacking the framework into a project produces this layout:

```
<project root>/
├── AGENT_GUIDE.md              # THE canon — read before every task (rules, map, commands, conventions)
├── PHILOSOPHY.md               # how the agent thinks: KISS + Occam (the simplicity principle)
├── BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md     # how the agent debugs: the fix→build→test loop, the 3-attempts rule
├── STATUS.md                   # the living state — updated after every significant task
│
├── plans/                      # strategy & knowledge
│   ├── master_plan.md          #   the roadmap and phases (where we're going)
│   ├── project_map.md          #   the architecture map (how it's built)
│   └── ideas/                  #   agent/human feature proposals — NN_*.md, DONE-tagged when shipped
│
├── bugs/                       # one NN_*.md per bug (symptom/repro/forensics/root cause/fix), DONE-tagged
├── interviews/                 # interview_NNN_*.md — A/B/C questions for the human on owner-level decisions
│
├── .kaif/kaif.json             # deploy marker: version · release date · origin · tracking · sphere · agent
├── package.json                # KAIF adds kaif:* npm handles here (respectfully; removed on uninstall)
│
└── .claude/
    └── skills/                 # the repeatable rituals (slash-skills) — 17 in all
        ├── resume · pause                            # session start / end
        ├── autoloop · dayloop · nightloop            # autonomous work loops
        ├── refresh-context · check-backlog           # context & backlog hygiene
        ├── report-bug · bug-research · propose-idea   # knowledge capture
        ├── interview · release                       # ask the owner · ship a release
        └── kaif-version · kaif-update · kaif-fork · kaif-switch-origin · kaif-remove  # KAIF lifecycle
```

Plus the wiring: the agent's auto-loaded context file (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, or `AGENTS.md` for
other agents — see §13) is pointed at `AGENT_GUIDE.md` so every session reads the canon; a small `kaif`
tool backs the `kaif:*` npm handles (§11); and `.kaif/kaif.json` records the deployment.

> **Note on skills directory.** The skills above use the Claude Code convention
> (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with YAML frontmatter `name` + `description`). For a different agent,
> place the same SKILL.md content wherever that agent discovers commands, or simply keep them as
> documents the human invokes by name — the *content* is what matters, not the path.

---

## 4. The four guidance documents

These four files are the agent's brain on disk. Each template below is generic: replace every
`<PLACEHOLDER>` with the project's real value during unpacking. `PHILOSOPHY.md` and
`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` are universal — copy them verbatim.

> **FILE: `AGENT_GUIDE.md`** — project root — replace every `<PLACEHOLDER>` with the project's real values

``````md
# <PROJECT_NAME> — AI Agent Guide

This file is read by the AI agent before every task. It is the **canon** of the project: the rules,
the map, the commands, the conventions. Keep it accurate — a fresh agent session with empty context
relies entirely on this document to get to work.

> 🧠 **PRIME PRINCIPLE — SIMPLICITY (read `PHILOSOPHY.md`).** If something is taking a long time, it is
> NOT a hard task and NOT a library bug — the agent is DOING IT TOO COMPLEX because it did NOT UNDERSTAND
> THE TASK. Everything should be simple (KISS + Occam). Stuck → re-understand the task, find the
> built-in simple path, do NOT escalate complexity. A stall = "simplify your understanding," not "dig harder."

> 🤖 **AUTONOMOUS MODE.** When the human has stepped away / granted autonomy and there is no active
> interactive task, and `STATUS.md` has an open autonomous backlog — the agent SHOULD, on its own
> initiative, enter the appropriate loop skill (`/autoloop`, `/dayloop`, or `/nightloop`) and grind the
> backlog, committing progress and self-restarting after each task. Stop only on the skill's stop
> conditions. Do not enter a loop if the human just gave a specific interactive task.

---

## Before every task — checklist

```
1. Read STATUS.md                 # current state: what's done, where we are, what's next
2. git status                     # what changed, what's uncommitted
3. git log --oneline -5           # where we are in history
4. Read MEMORY.md (if present)    # user profile, key decisions
5. Read the relevant plan         # plans/<feature>.md, if the task touches a specific feature
6. Run the build (if touching code)   # <BUILD_COMMAND>
7. Use the test harness           # <TEST_HARNESS> — drive/observe the software without a human
8. Comment the code               # comment blocks, classes, modules, important lines
9. Reflect on bugs in bugs/       # one md per bug; follow BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md
10. Periodically re-read the key guidance docs:
    - PHILOSOPHY.md   ← the simplicity principle; if stuck, go here first
    - AGENT_GUIDE.md
    - STATUS.md
    - BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md
    Edit them when it would make future autonomous work more effective. The agent operates across
    sessions that lose context — these docs must let a fresh session get productive from empty context.
11. Narrate in the chat, at least a little, in natural language — what you're doing right now — so the
    human can glance over and follow along.
12. Documents from the human (ideas, bugs, features): read them, fix typos, minimally restructure into a
    clean structured format for AI consumption. After implementing from such a document, write the
    status and the implementation date back into it.
```

→ **`STATUS.md`** is the master state file. Update it after every significant task.

## Project identity (CANON — use these, don't invent)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name / brand** | `<PROJECT_NAME>` |
| **Short name** | `<SHORT_NAME>` |
| **GitHub repository** | `<REPO_URL>` |
| **Local project folder** | `<LOCAL_PATH>` |
| **Author / owner** | `<AUTHOR>` |
| **License** | `<LICENSE>` |

> Keep one canonical spelling for names/paths/URLs and use it everywhere. If you find an old/renamed
> identifier in historical docs, normalize it to the canonical value above.

---

## Goal of the project

`<ONE-PARAGRAPH STATEMENT OF WHAT THIS PROJECT IS AND FOR WHOM. Keep it short and concrete.>`

---

## Architecture — the map

`<HIGH-LEVEL MODULE/COMPONENT MAP. The directory layout, the modules, and the dependency rules between
them. Keep this in sync with plans/project_map.md (the detailed map). Example:>`

```
<module-a>      ← entry point / app
<module-b>      ← <responsibility>
<module-c>      ← <responsibility>
```

**RULE:** `<state the key architectural invariant, e.g. "feature modules don't depend on each other">`.

Full file map and data flows live in `plans/project_map.md`.

---

## Build

```bash
<BUILD_COMMAND>
```

`<Note any environment gotchas: required toolchain version, env vars (e.g. JAVA_HOME), how to check
for errors only, how to do a headless vs. interactive build.>`

---

## Test harness (how the agent observes & drives the software)

`<Describe the tooling the agent uses to run, observe, and drive the software WITHOUT a human — the
single most important investment for autonomous work. For a GUI app: a UI-automation/inspection tool.
For a server: a request runner + log tail. For a CLI: scripted invocations + golden outputs. Always
prefer deterministic reproduction and objective verification over eyeballing. Grow this tooling over
time and document new commands here.>`

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `<cmd>` | `<...>` |

> Full harness guide: `<path to your harness/automation guide, if any>`.

---

## Git workflow

`<State your branching policy. A simple, effective default — used by this framework's own project —
is: work ONLY in `main`, no feature branches; commit incrementally and often; to undo, use git history
(git revert / git checkout <hash> -- file), not branches. Pick what fits your project and state it here
so the agent doesn't improvise.>`

## Commits

Style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `ci:` + one line of what was done.
End every commit message with the co-author trailer:

```
Co-Authored-By: <YOUR AGENT/MODEL> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

`<If you use a commit/version tool (e.g. tools/commit.mjs that bumps a build number, commits, pushes),
document it here.>`

## Push / GitHub authentication

`<Document how pushing and GitHub operations are authenticated in this environment (e.g. `gh auth
setup-git` to use the gh token as a git credential helper), and the recovery steps if a push fails
(non-fast-forward → git pull --rebase → retry).>`

---

## Tools

`<Table of the project's automation tools (build, commit, release, codegen, graphics, etc.). Keep it
current — when you add or extend a tool, add a row here.>`

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `<cmd>` | `<...>` |

---

## Backlog & the DONE tag

So that the file listing alone tells you what's open vs. closed — **insert the word `DONE` into the
filename after the number when a file's task is completed and verified:**

```
bugs/04_modal.md                →  bugs/04_DONE_modal.md
plans/ideas/07_dev_menu.md      →  plans/ideas/07_DONE_dev_menu.md
```

**Rule (do this every time you work with bug/idea files):**
- Finished a bug/idea and it is CONFIRMED closed (status ✅, verified) — rename immediately, inserting
  `DONE` after the number: `git mv <NN>_<name>.md <NN>_DONE_<name>.md`.
- A file in progress / partial / research-only — do NOT mark `DONE` (🔧/🟡/🔬 = not done yet).
- Use `git mv` (preserves history). Don't change the number.
- Reference docs in `plans/` (master_plan, project_map, etc.) are NOT tasks — never tag them DONE.

**Backlog revision skill — `/check-backlog`:** walks `bugs/` and `plans/`, collects everything without a
`DONE` tag as the open backlog, and tags genuinely-closed files DONE (with a status section appended).

**Bug reporting skill — `/report-bug`:** hit a defect during dev/test — file a dedicated md in `bugs/`
by the canon, per `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. The agent keeps its own bug backlog — one doc per defect,
nothing lost.

**Idea proposal skill — `/propose-idea`:** had a worthwhile idea that fits the master plan and the
human's vision — file it as an md in `plans/ideas/` with status "❓ awaiting human approval." An
agent's idea is a contribution to the product VISION → implement ONLY after the human approves.

---

## Decisions the agent must NOT make alone — interviews

Before a significant new feature, and whenever a brand/UX/architecture fork appears, conduct an
**interview** with the human using the `/interview` skill: closed A/B/C questions, recommendation first,
answered by the human directly in `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md`. Never make UI/UX/brand/
architecture decisions without confirmation. Everything else — decide yourself with sensible defaults
and report in the chat.

Rule of thumb: *is it cheap to reverse?* If yes — decide yourself. If it shapes brand/architecture/UX
for the long term — interview.

---

## Code style

`<Project-specific code style. A universal baseline:>`
- Comment all non-trivial blocks and modules — what the code does and why, and what it connects to.
  This is for transparency, traceability, and future maintainability across context-losing sessions.
- No magic numbers — named constants with clear names.
- Prefer the platform/library's idiomatic, built-in way over a hand-rolled mechanism.
- `<add language/framework-specific rules here>`

---

## Notes from the human

`<Free-form, high-signal guidance from the project owner — the kind of thing that doesn't fit a
category but matters. Examples this framework was distilled from:>`
- Always check the current time and the log file's time before reading logs — read fresh logs, not stale ones.
- Work autonomously without interactive questions. If you need information from the human, write an
  interview document and pause the session (so the human is signaled to come answer), rather than blocking.
- If you find bugs in third-party libraries, file tickets for them via `gh` on the human's behalf.
- Actively test what you build, using whatever tooling lets you drive the software effectively.
- Periodically re-read and, where useful, improve your own guidance docs so a fresh session can be
  effective despite context loss. Steer and tune yourself toward maximum effectiveness and autonomy
  toward the stated goal.

# PHILOSOPHY — How the agent thinks: SIMPLICITY (KISS + Occam's Razor)

> This document is the agent's primary thinking principle on this project. Read it alongside
> `AGENT_GUIDE.md` and `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. Whenever a "clever complex solution" conflicts
> with a "simple" one — choose the simple one.

---

## The core idea

> **If something takes a long time to build or fix, it is almost never because the task is too hard
> or the library is broken. It is because the agent is DOING IT TOO COMPLEX — because it did NOT
> UNDERSTAND THE TASK.**
>
> **Everything should be done simply. Not working = RE-UNDERSTAND the task, don't pile on complexity.**

Unpacked:

- Libraries, frameworks, and platforms are **simple to use by design**. Almost everything has already
  been figured out before us. There is rarely a need to "reinvent the rocket."
- If a fix becomes bulky, multi-step, full of flags and workarounds — that is a **red flag**: the agent
  most likely didn't understand *how it actually works* and is fighting an imagined complexity, not the
  real task.
- Getting stuck is a signal NOT to "dig deeper into the complex," but to **stop and simplify the
  understanding**.

---

## Occam's Razor

**Do not multiply entities without necessity.** Of two solutions that explain/solve the same thing,
pick the one with fewer assumptions, less code, fewer moving parts.

In practice:

- Fewer states, flags, special cases, "crutches propping up crutches."
- If a solution needs five interlocking hacks — there is almost certainly one simple solution we
  failed to see because we misunderstood the task.
- A complex solution that "seems to work" is worse than a simple one that *demonstrably* works.

## KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid

**Simplicity is the goal, not a side effect.** The simplest solution that does the job is the correct
one. Add complexity only when it is objectively NECESSARY and proven — never "just in case."

In practice:

- First state the task in one or two plain sentences. If you can't, you don't understand it yet.
- Look for the built-in, out-of-the-box way in the library/platform *before* writing your own mechanism.
- If you're writing something clever, ask: "how would a simple person, or an off-the-shelf tool, do this?"

---

## The rule when stuck

1. **3 attempts** of "fix → build → test" without success = STOP. Stop poking blindly
   (see `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`).
2. Don't "dig harder" — **re-understand the task**: re-read what was actually asked, in plain words.
   The simple answer is often already there.
3. Run deep research (`/bug-research`): understand HOW it actually works (docs/source), don't guess.
   The goal is to find the SIMPLE, supported path.
4. Form a simple hypothesis and a simple plan. If the plan is complex again — you still don't
   understand the task.

---

## Illustration: the imagined-complexity trap

A typical failure mode: an agent receives a task it half-understands, picks a complicated mental model,
and then spends hours wrestling that model — trying flag after flag, inverting parameters, stacking
special cases — each attempt distorting the result a different way. This is fighting an *imagined*
problem.

The way out is never "try a sixth variation." It is to put the keyboard down and re-state the task in
one plain sentence — often a sentence the human can give you instantly. Nine times out of ten the plain
statement contains a simple, supported path that makes all the clever machinery unnecessary.

> The lesson: the task was simple. The agent invented a hard one, then got stuck in it.
> **Didn't understand → over-complicated → stuck.**

---

## The simplicity checklist (run before writing a complex solution)

- [ ] Can I explain the task in one plain sentence?
- [ ] Is there a built-in way in the library/platform? Did I look in the docs/source?
- [ ] Is my solution the minimum number of entities, or am I breeding flags and special cases?
- [ ] If the solution is complex — am I sure I understood the task, or am I fighting an imagined problem?
- [ ] What would an off-the-shelf tool / standard API do here?
- [ ] Have I already made ≥3 failed attempts? Then STOP → re-understand, don't escalate complexity.
- [ ] What would a resourceful human do? What ingenuity, creativity, or out-of-the-box thinking would help?

# BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK — how the agent fixes defects

To fix a bug, the agent must:

- **Focus on this one bug only.** Don't refactor the world; don't fix three other things along the way.
- **Narrate in the chat**, at least a little, in natural language — what you are doing right now — so
  the human can glance over and understand where the work is.
- **Reflect and capture knowledge** for every bug, even small ones, in a dedicated markdown file per
  bug in the `bugs/` directory.
- **Enter the loop:** run the app → reproduce the bug → read the logs for this bug → form a guess at the
  cause → make a *single, targeted* change → build → run the app again → try to reproduce again.
- The essence: **targeted changes, then a build to test whether the change helped or not.**
- Simplified: Fix → Test → Read logs → Fix → Test → Read logs → … until it works correctly. Working
  correctly **is the acceptance criterion** — at that point the bug is considered fixed.
- To fix a bug, it is often useful to **search the web** for the solution — forums, GitHub issues,
  Reddit, Stack Overflow, official docs.

> ⚠️ **THE 3-ATTEMPTS RULE → switch to research (`/bug-research`).**
> If after **three iterations** of "targeted fix → build → test" the bug is NOT fixed — STOP going
> blind and poking at random. Further random attempts waste time and builds, and (if the test depends
> on external services) are unreliable. Instead, run the **`/bug-research`** skill: deep web search with
> the raw knowledge base written into the bug document, reading and analyzing the code WITHOUT edits to
> locate the cause, reflection, and a justified hypothesis + plan. Return to fixing only once you
> understand the cause. Skill: `.claude/skills/bug-research/SKILL.md`.
>
> 🧠 **AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY (see `PHILOSOPHY.md`):** a long stall almost always means you are making
> the FIX TOO COMPLEX because you did NOT UNDERSTAND the task — NOT that the task is hard or the library
> is "buggy." Libraries are simple; it's all been figured out before us. If the fix is bulky, with a

> to "dig harder."

- For effective fixing, the code must be **commented**.
- For effective fixing you MUST reflect and write down your knowledge about working on this bug into a
  dedicated document about *this specific* fixing work. Such ruminations should and must be kept as
  separate markdown documents in the `bugs/` directory.
- To be able to interact with the program under test, you can and should **install or build extra
  tooling** that lets the agent observe and drive the software: see its output, inspect its state,
  reproduce the defect deterministically, and exercise it without a human. Invest in that instrumentation
  — it pays for itself across every future bug.

---

## Instrumentation — build a test harness, don't guess

The single biggest force multiplier for autonomous debugging is a **harness**: tooling that lets the
agent reproduce and observe a bug on its own, without a human in the loop and without unreliable manual
inspection.

Principles:

- **Never guess what the program is doing — observe it.** Add structured logging, a debug command
  channel, a deterministic way to drive the software into the exact state that triggers the bug.
- **Make reproduction deterministic.** A bug you can reproduce on demand is a bug you can fix. A bug
  you see "sometimes" is a research task first (`/bug-research`).
- **Prefer objective verification over eyeballing.** If a visual/manual check is unreliable (subtle
  distortions, timing), invent an objective check (a known-shape control input, a measurable output, a
  size/checksum log) and write it into the bug document.
- **Grow the harness over time.** Every time you do something manually to reproduce or verify, ask:
  "can I add a command/flag/script so next time it's one step?" Then add it, and document it in
  `AGENT_GUIDE.md`. The harness is a living tool — extend and document it.

---

## Working with logs

- Always check the **current time** and the **timestamp of the log file/entries** before reading — so
  you read fresh, relevant logs, not yesterday's.
- Filter logs to the bug: grep for the relevant subsystem, error text, crash markers.
- Attach the key lines (stack trace, abort message, error codes, sizes) into the bug document — they are
  the forensics future sessions will rely on.

---

## The bug document (one per bug, in `bugs/`)

Capture, don't narrate. A good bug doc lets a future session (with empty context) pick the bug up cold.
Canonical structure (see `/report-bug` for the full template):

```
# Bug NN — <one-line description>

**Status:** 🔴 OPEN  (or 🟡 partial / 🔬 research-only / 🔧 fix pending verification / ✅ DONE)
**Version/build:** <...>   ·   **When/context:** <date, during which task it was found>

## Symptom
<what is observed, and how it differs from expected>

## Repro (deterministic)
<steps; harness commands if available>

## Forensics
<key logs / crash / measurements>

## Root cause / Hypotheses
<the cause if known; otherwise ranked hypotheses — do NOT patch blindly>

## Fix plan (or the fix, if done)
<steps; relation to architecture / other bugs>

## Links
<related bugs / ideas / interviews>
```

When the bug is confirmed fixed and verified, mark it DONE by the `DONE`-tag convention (rename
`bugs/NN_x.md` → `bugs/NN_DONE_x.md` and append a `## ✅ STATUS: DONE (date)` section). See
`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → "Backlog & the DONE tag" and the `/check-backlog` skill.

---

## If the bug is in someone else's library

If you find a genuine defect in a third-party dependency, file an issue/ticket in their tracker (e.g.
via the `gh` CLI, on the human's behalf if authorized), and reference that ticket from your bug document.
This both helps the ecosystem and documents why you worked around it.

---

## 5. The knowledge directories

### `plans/` — strategy & knowledge

- **`master_plan.md`** — the project's roadmap: vision, principles, tech stack, the phased plan
  (Phase 0…N with milestones), and a decision log. This is "where we're going." Created by inspecting the
  project and interviewing the owner about vision.
- **`project_map.md`** — the architecture map: modules/components, what each is responsible for, the
  dependency rules between them, and the data-flow diagram. This is "how it's built." Kept in sync with
  the real code; a fresh session reads it to navigate.
- **`ideas/`** — feature proposals, one `NN_<name>.md` each (see `/propose-idea`). DONE-tagged when shipped.
- Reference docs (`master_plan.md`, `project_map.md`, `goal.md`, worklogs, `homework_*.md`) are **living
  references, not closable tasks** — never DONE-tagged.

### `bugs/` — one document per defect

Every bug — even a small one — gets a `bugs/NN_<name>.md` (see `/report-bug`): symptom, deterministic
repro, forensics, root cause/hypotheses, fix plan, links. While open, no `DONE` tag. When fixed and
verified, `git mv` it to `NN_DONE_<name>.md` and append a `## ✅ STATUS: DONE (date)` section. This is the
agent's own bug backlog — nothing is lost, and any bug can be picked up cold by a future session.

### `interviews/` — owner-level decisions

`interview_NNN_<topic>.md` (see `/interview`): closed A/B/C questions with a recommendation first,
answered by the human **directly in the document**. Used only for decisions the agent must not make alone
(UI/UX, serious technical forks, brand/vision/priorities). The async, document-based format keeps the
agent unblocked: it files the questions, pauses, and the human answers when convenient.

---

## 6. The skills

The skills are the framework's repeatable rituals — the verbs of working on a project. Each is a
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). The `description`
is what the agent matches against to trigger the skill; keep the trigger phrases (including the
owner's language) intact.

During unpacking, copy each skill verbatim, replacing the command placeholders
(`<BUILD_COMMAND>`, `<COMMIT_COMMAND>`, `<TEST_HARNESS>`) with the project's real commands.

| Skill | When | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `resume` | session start | Read the docs, pick the one main thing, announce, begin. |
| `pause` | session end | Update STATUS & README, build, commit, push, report. |
| `autoloop` | autonomy | Grind a pool of autonomous tasks in a self-restarting series. |
| `dayloop` | autonomy | Continuous autonomous work while the human is busy (no time stop). |
| `nightloop` | autonomy | Autonomous work until a wake time / the human returns. |
| `refresh-context` | hygiene | Re-read the master plan, map, and guidance; rebuild the backlog. |
| `check-backlog` | hygiene | Walk `bugs/`+`plans/`, tag finished work DONE, return the open list. |
| `report-bug` | knowledge | File a bug document by the canon. |
| `bug-research` | knowledge | Deep investigation without coding, after 3 failed fix attempts. |
| `propose-idea` | knowledge | Propose a feature/improvement for the human's approval. |
| `interview` | human | Ask the owner closed A/B/C questions on a fateful decision. |
| `release` | shipping | Publish a release to GitHub (with confirmation; never autonomously). |
| `kaif-version` | lifecycle | Report the deployed KAIF version; check origin for a newer release. |
| `kaif-update` | lifecycle | Respectful migration update from origin, preserving customizations & artifacts. |
| `kaif-fork` | lifecycle | Snapshot KAIF into the user's own repo and track it. |
| `kaif-switch-origin` | lifecycle | Return tracking to the official origin (respectful migration). |
| `kaif-remove` | lifecycle | Respectfully remove KAIF — partial (keep artifacts) or full. |

name: resume
description: Resume work where the last session left off — read the key project documents, decide the single most important thing to do now, announce it, and start. Use when the human says "continue", "let's continue", "what's next", "where did we leave off", "resume", "pick up where we left off", "продолжи", "продолжим", "что дальше".
---

# /resume — pick up where we left off

A new session starts with empty context. This skill rebuilds the picture fast and gets to work.

## Step 1. Read the key documents (all in parallel)

Read at once:

- `STATUS.md` — current state, what's in progress, the "where to continue" checklist
- `plans/master_plan.md` — the long-term plan and phases
- `AGENT_GUIDE.md` — the rules for working on this project (mandatory)
- `plans/project_map.md` — architecture: modules, files, data flow

If relevant to open questions:
- `bugs/` — `ls bugs/`, open the non-`DONE` bugs
- `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` — if a bug fix is likely
- `PHILOSOPHY.md` — the simplicity principle

## Step 2. Synthesize — choose the one main thing

Pick a single direction for this session. Priority (descending):

1. **Open bugs with real symptoms** — if `STATUS.md` lists an open bug with reproducible symptoms, it's
   priority #1. Work by `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`.
2. **Next item from the `STATUS.md` "where to continue" checklist** — if bugs are clear.
3. **Next phase from `master_plan.md`** — if the checklist is empty/done.

Before starting, **tell the human in one paragraph**: what you read and the current status; what you
picked as the main thing and why; what you're about to do right now.

Wait for confirmation only if the task is **destructive** or **large and non-obvious**. If the plan is
clear — start right after the short announcement.

## Step 3. Work

Do the chosen task. Along the way:
- Write short updates in the chat (what you're doing, what you found, where you're digging).
- Follow `AGENT_GUIDE.md` (code style, the bug framework, the test harness).
- If it's a bug — keep a log in the relevant `bugs/` file.

## Notes

- Verify the environment before relying on it (build toolchain, devices, services) — see `AGENT_GUIDE.md`.
- Don't re-derive what the docs already state; trust `STATUS.md` and the plans, then verify by doing.

name: pause
description: End a work session (pause) — record status and next-session plans in STATUS.md, refresh README, (re)build the project, commit and push. Use when the human says "let's pause", "wrap up", "save progress", "commit and push", "end the session", "сделаем паузу", "заверши сессию", "зафиксируй статус".
---

# /pause — end the work session

The human is pausing. Run the wrap-up routine **in order**. Narrate each step briefly in the chat.
Don't skip steps. If a step fails — stop, tell the human, don't continue blindly.

## Step 1. Record status & plans in STATUS.md

Update `STATUS.md`:
- **What was done this session** — concrete, tied to bugs/features and files.
- **Current position** — what works, what's in progress, where we are.
- **Plans for next session** — a clear "where to continue" checklist (commands, files, what to verify
  first). Remember: the next agent session starts with empty context — write so it can jump straight in.
- Convert relative dates to absolute (find today's date from context / `date`).

Reconcile with the active bug docs in `bugs/` and reflect their status.

## Step 2. Refresh README

Bring `README.md` in line with reality: phase status, working features, instructions. If the README is
bilingual, keep both languages in sync. Don't invent — reflect only what is actually done and verified.

## Step 3. (Re)build / regenerate artifacts

`<Run the project build and any artifact regeneration (e.g. a rendered README.pdf). For this framework's
own project: `node tools/build-framework.mjs` regenerates FRAMEWORK.md, and `node tools/readme-pdf.mjs`
regenerates README.pdf.>` If a build fails, stop and show the errors — don't commit broken state.

## Step 4. Commit and push

`<Use your commit tool/flow. If you have one (e.g. tools/commit.mjs that bumps build, adds, commits,
pushes), run it. Otherwise: git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push.>`

Message style (from `AGENT_GUIDE.md`): `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `refactor:` / `ci:` + one line.
End the message with:
```
Co-Authored-By: <YOUR AGENT/MODEL> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Step 5. Report

Briefly report to the human: what was recorded, what was built, the commit hash, what was pushed, and
one line — the main plan for next session. That's the pause.

## Notes

- If a push is rejected (non-fast-forward) — `git pull --rebase`, retry the push, then tell the human
  about the divergence.
- Generated artifacts that are gitignored (e.g. README.pdf, build outputs) won't be committed — that's fine.

name: autoloop
description: Run the agent in a LONG autonomous series over a pool of AUTONOMOUS tasks (tasks that need no human and no special resources). The agent picks a task from the pool, writes code, builds, tests on the harness, fixes, commits, and takes the next one. Invoked by the human ("run the autonomous loop", "work on your own", "autopilot", "autoloop", "grind the backlog", "work while I step away", "работай сам", "автопилот", "погриндь беклог") AND by the agent on its own initiative when there is an autonomous backlog, no active interactive task, and the environment is ready (the agent enters the mode and self-restarts after each task).
---

# /autoloop — long autonomous work over a task pool

The human steps away / doesn't want to intervene. The agent's job: **enter a self-directed loop and
grind the pool of AUTONOMOUS tasks** one by one, until the pool is empty or a blocker appears. Between
tasks — short chat reports so the human can glance in and see progress.

## 🔁 Self-invoke and self-restart (the agent starts itself)

The agent may and SHOULD invoke this skill **on its own initiative** (via the Skill tool), without
waiting for an explicit command, when ALL conditions hold:
- there are open tasks in the AUTONOMOUS pool (`STATUS.md` → "🤖 Autonomous backlog pool");
- there is no active interactive task/question from the human right now (they stepped away / granted autonomy);
- the environment is ready (build works; any needed devices/services are available).

Moreover, **the loop self-restarts**: having finished one task (commit + short report), the agent
proceeds to the next iteration of this same skill — **immediately invokes `/autoloop` again** and takes
the next task, without waiting for a command. So the series runs long and continuously. Stop ONLY by the
conditions in "When to STOP" below.

> ⛔ **ANTI-PATTERN (don't do this):** finish a task and "ask the human: continue or stop?" when the
> pool STILL has a task. That violates the skill. "Long session", "late", "lots of context", "risk of a
> limit", "tired" — are NOT stop conditions. If the pool has an autonomous task — invoke `/autoloop`
> yourself and continue. Stop EXCLUSIVELY by the list below. Context and limits are the harness's
> concern, not a reason to break the autonomous series.

> Don't abuse it: self-invocation is for the autonomous pool. If the human gave a specific interactive
> task — do that, don't run off into a loop. If they explicitly said "stop / enough / pause" — stop.

> 🧠 Work by `PHILOSOPHY.md` (SIMPLE, KISS, Occam) and `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` (3 attempts → stop →
> `/bug-research`). Comment your code. Narrate in the chat what you're doing.

## The autonomy boundary (hard limit)

Some tasks need the human (their hands, eyes, accounts, decisions on UX/brand/architecture) or special
resources the agent can't access right now. **Do NOT take those tasks — defer them, take another.** Keep
the boundary explicit in `STATUS.md`'s autonomous pool: list only tasks verifiable WITHOUT the human and
without those resources.

## Step 0. Setup (once at the start)

1. Read: `STATUS.md` (the "🤖 Autonomous backlog pool" section), `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `AGENT_GUIDE.md`,
   `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`, the relevant `plans/ideas/*` and `bugs/*`.
2. Check the environment is ready (build toolchain, devices/services — see `AGENT_GUIDE.md`).
3. Assemble/refresh the working pool list from STATUS. Tell the human in one paragraph: what's in the
   pool, which task you start with, and why.

## The cycle (repeat per task)

1. **Pick** the next autonomous task from the pool (priority from STATUS). Verify it can be checked
   WITHOUT the human/special resources. If not — defer, take the next.
2. **Understand it simply** (PHILOSOPHY) — state it in 1–2 sentences. For bugs — open/create a `bugs/` doc.
3. **Implement** in a targeted way, with comments. Don't over-complicate.
4. **Build** (`<BUILD_COMMAND>`). If errors — fix them, don't commit broken state.
5. **Deploy/run** as your project requires.
6. **Verify autonomously** on the harness (`<TEST_HARNESS>`). Look at the result carefully — don't
   wishful-think; verify objectively.
7. **Fix cycle** on a bug: fix → build → test → logs (fresh by timestamp). The **3-attempts** rule →
   `/bug-research` (no code) → then fix.
8. **Capture knowledge**: for bugs — reflection in `bugs/NN_*.md`; for features — status/date in
   `plans/ideas/*`; update `STATUS.md`.
9. **Commit** a small commit (don't lose progress): `<COMMIT_COMMAND>` (style from `AGENT_GUIDE.md`,
   with the Co-Authored-By trailer).
10. **Short chat report** (1–3 lines): what you did, what you verified, what's next. → next task.

## Self-pacing (so the loop runs LONG)

- Go task after task without stopping for confirmations (unless a task is destructive).
- If you're waiting on a background operation (a long build) — continue when ready; don't ping the human.
- If you need to "continue on a timer", use the harness's loop mechanism (`ScheduleWakeup`/`/loop`) with
  a reasonable interval, passing this same skill back so the cycle resumes.

## When to STOP the loop (and report to the human)

- The autonomous pool is exhausted (everything left needs the human/resources).
- A serious UI/UX/brand/architecture fork the agent must NOT decide alone → file an `/interview` and pause.
- Something destructive/irreversible (a release, a deletion, a force-push) — don't do it alone, ask.

At the end of the loop — a summary: what got done across the series (list of commits), what was deferred
and why, what to propose next. The commits along the way guarantee no progress is lost.

## Notes

- Do NOT publish releases, do NOT force-push, do NOT delete others' work — that's outside autonomy.
- Keep the tree clean before committing; generated artifacts are gitignored.
- Read only FRESH logs (verify by timestamp).

name: dayloop
description: Daytime autonomous work loop while the human is BUSY and can't attend to the chat. The agent takes ANY task from the backlog (that doesn't need a human architectural decision), writes code, builds, tests on the harness, fixes, periodically commits and PUSHES, and works CONTINUOUSLY (no pauses, no time checks). Unlike nightloop there is NO requirement to stop at a certain time — it works as long as there's a backlog. Stops ONLY when: (1) the human writes in the chat, (2) an insurmountable critical error. Invoked by the human ("run the day loop", "work on your own, I'm busy", "dayloop", "grind the backlog") and by the agent when the human is busy and offline.
---

# /dayloop — daytime autonomous work while the human is busy

Daytime. The human is BUSY — can't attend to the chat, no one to answer, don't ping them. The machine is
on, the harness is available. The agent's job: **enter a self-directed loop and grind the backlog
autonomously**, setting its own tasks, making its own non-architectural decisions, committing/pushing,
and working CONTINUOUSLY (no pauses, no time checks).

This is the "working-hours" variant of `/nightloop`: same execution discipline and full autonomy, but
**without a time-based stop** — the day isn't bounded; work as long as there's something in the backlog.

## 🛑 STOP CONDITIONS (check at the START of each iteration)

Stop the loop ONLY if one of:
1. **The human wrote in the chat.** Any new user message = exit the loop immediately, switch to them.
2. **ONLY a truly critical error** that can't be worked around autonomously and makes continuing
   impossible in principle (toolchain hopelessly broken; repo in an unresolvable state). This is RARE.
   ❗ **Non-critical errors are NOT a stop condition — just keep working:** a failed build (fix it), a
   flaky connection (reconnect), a bug in the software (file it and fix or defer), a hard/unclear task
   (take another), a crash (investigate/fix). These are normal working situations.

⚠️ **No time-stop, no pauses, no time checks.** Unlike the night loop, don't stop at any hour and don't
look at the clock. Work **CONTINUOUSLY**: finished one — take the next. Don't pause, don't wait for
confirmations, don't schedule big "wake up later" gaps. The only stop is a stop condition above. A
**short** `ScheduleWakeup` (≈60s) is NOT a pause — it's the loop's heartbeat to continue in a new turn
when the current one is exhausted (see step 7).

## 🔁 The cycle (one iteration)

1. **Check stop conditions** (above). If stop — go to "Finishing".
2. **Pick ANY backlog task** — scale unlimited (a big one is fine). Sources: `STATUS.md` → "where to
   continue" / active items, `bugs/` (open), `plans/ideas/` (open), loose ends. Priority: finish started
   > bugs/polish > new ideas.
   - **Make decisions yourself** (technical, implementation, approach) — don't wait for the human.
   - **ONLY brand/UX/architecture-defining decisions** (shape the product long-term, not yours to make
     alone) — don't do them blind: file the question in `interviews/interview_NNN_*.md` (`/interview`)
     AND mark `STATUS.md` "❓ awaiting human review: …". Then take ANOTHER task and continue.
   - If a task needs **human actions** (test on real hardware, external accounts) — file **homework** in
     `plans/homework_*.md` and move on.
3. **Do it**: code → build (`<BUILD_COMMAND>`) → deploy → test on the harness (`<TEST_HARNESS>`),
   verify objectively. Use the high-level harness commands; if one is missing, do it the low-level way,
   then ADD a command to the harness so next time it's one step.
4. **Document**: a worklog in `plans/`, bug docs in `bugs/`, `STATUS.md` along the way.
5. **Commit and PUSH** (per `AGENT_GUIDE.md` git workflow): after each finished task or every ~20–30
   minutes. `<COMMIT_COMMAND>`.
6. **Short chat report** (1–3 lines): what you did, what's next — so the human sees progress on a break.
7. **Continue CONTINUOUSLY**: finished a task — next iteration in the same turn. No pauses, no waiting,
   no time checks.
   - **Loop heartbeat (`ScheduleWakeup`):** when the current TURN is exhausted (context filled / turn
     naturally ended) but work remains and no stop condition fired — call `ScheduleWakeup` with the same
     `/dayloop` input and a **minimal** interval (≈60s) so the cycle resumes immediately in a new turn.
     This is NOT a pause — it's how the loop survives the turn boundary and keeps grinding.
   - Do NOT use `ScheduleWakeup` as a pause/wait: no big "wait an hour" intervals, no time-gating.

## ⚙️ Practice

- **Don't go interactive:** the human is busy — no questions in chat with waiting for an answer.
  Human-level decisions — file in `interviews/` + mark STATUS, take another task.
- **Change safety:** small verified commits; if you break something, fix it or revert via git history.
- **🔄 Periodically refresh context** — every few iterations call `/refresh-context`.
- **🧹 Occasionally revise the backlog** — every few iterations (not every) call `/check-backlog`.
- **🐞 Hit a bug** you won't fix right now — file it with `/report-bug`.
- **💡 A worthwhile NEW idea** (in line with the master plan/vision) — file it with `/propose-idea` and
  continue with OTHER tasks. **Don't implement it before the human approves.**

## Backlog empty / nothing to do

If no open tasks remain in `bugs/` and `plans/ideas/` (all DONE or awaiting the human) — **still don't
pause and don't wait**, keep working:
- Polish/refactor/tests/docs per `PHILOSOPHY.md` (KISS) — acceptable work.
- Form and record in `STATUS.md` proposals of new tasks/ideas for the human.
- Continue the next iteration until a stop condition fires.

## Finishing (when a stop condition fired)

- Get the current micro-step to a compiling state, **commit and push** (don't leave broken/uncommitted main).
- Update `STATUS.md`: what's done, where you stopped, what's next, any "❓ awaiting human review".
- If stop = the human wrote — switch to them; give a short summary of what got done.
- If stop = a critical error — describe it, what you tried, why you can't continue; wait.

## Notes

- This is an INTENSIVE mode: don't spare tokens/time, maximize useful autonomous work.
- The global goal and vision live in `STATUS.md`/`plans/`/`AGENT_GUIDE.md`/`PHILOSOPHY.md`. Keep checking against them.

# /nightloop — autonomous work until morning

Night. The human is ASLEEP — no interaction, no one to ask. The machine is on, the harness is available.
The agent's job: **enter a self-directed loop and grind the backlog until morning**, setting itself
not-too-hard tasks, committing/pushing, and self-restarting the loop.

This is the night variant of `/autoloop`: same execution discipline, but with **hard stop conditions on
time and on the human appearing**, and **self-restart via `ScheduleWakeup`**.

## 🛑 STOP CONDITIONS (check at the START of each iteration)

Stop the loop ONLY if one of:
1. **It is ≥ the wake time** (default 09:00 local; set it when starting the loop). ⏰ Check the time
   (`date "+%H:%M"`) PERIODICALLY — don't miss the wake hour. The human comes online in the morning.
2. **The human wrote in the chat.** Any new user message = exit, switch to them. The loop interrupts immediately.
3. **ONLY a truly critical error** that can't be worked around autonomously and makes continuing
   impossible in principle. RARE.
   ❗ **Non-critical errors are NOT a stop condition — just keep working:** failed build (fix), flaky
   connection (reconnect), software bug (file & fix or defer), hard task (take an easier one), crash
   (investigate/fix). Working situations, not reasons to stop.

Until one fires — don't stop, don't wait for confirmations, work.

## 🔁 The cycle (one iteration)

1. **Check stop conditions** (above). If stop — go to "Finishing".
2. **Pick ANY backlog task.** Sources & priority as in `/dayloop` (finish started > bugs/polish > new ideas).
   - Make technical/implementation decisions yourself.
   - ONLY brand/UX/architecture-defining decisions — file an `/interview` + mark `STATUS.md`, take another task.
   - Tasks needing human actions (real hardware, external accounts) — file homework in `plans/homework_*.md`.
3. **Do it**: code → build (`<BUILD_COMMAND>`) → deploy → test on the harness (`<TEST_HARNESS>`),
   verify objectively. High-level harness commands first; if missing, do it low-level then ADD the command.
4. **Document**: worklog in `plans/`, bug docs in `bugs/`, `STATUS.md` along the way.
5. **Commit and PUSH** (per `AGENT_GUIDE.md`): after each finished task or every ~20–30 minutes. `<COMMIT_COMMAND>`.
6. **Short chat report** (1–3 lines): so in the morning the human sees the progress.
7. **Self-restart**: call `ScheduleWakeup` with a short listen and the same `/nightloop` input, so the
   cycle continues in the next iteration if the current turn is exhausted. If there's work left in the
   turn — just continue the next iteration in the same turn.

## ⚙️ Practice

- **Don't go interactive:** no questions to the human with waiting — they're asleep. Human-level
  decisions (UX/brand/architecture) — defer with a note, don't decide alone.
- **Change safety:** small verified commits; if you break something, fix it or revert via git history.
- **⏰ Watch the time** (`date "+%H:%M"`) so you don't miss the wake hour (stop condition).
- **🔄 Periodically refresh context** — every few iterations call `/refresh-context`.
- **🧹 Occasionally revise the backlog** — every few iterations call `/check-backlog`.
- **🐞 Hit a bug** you won't fix now — file it with `/report-bug`.
- **💡 A worthwhile NEW idea** — file it with `/propose-idea` and continue with OTHER tasks. **Don't
  implement before the human approves.**

## Finishing (when a stop condition fired)

- Get the current micro-step compiling, **commit and push** (don't leave broken/uncommitted main).
- Update `STATUS.md`: what got done overnight, where you stopped, what's next, any "awaiting human review".
- If stop = wake time or the human wrote — write a short summary of the night in the chat.
- If stop = a critical error — describe it, what you tried, why you can't continue; wait.

## Notes

- This is an INTENSIVE mode: don't spare tokens/time, maximize useful autonomous work overnight.
- The global goal and vision live in `STATUS.md`/`plans/`/`AGENT_GUIDE.md`/`PHILOSOPHY.md`. Keep checking against them.

description: Refresh the project context — re-read the master plan and project map, the key guidance docs, walk bugs/ and plans/ (open, non-DONE) and rebuild the current backlog, then take something into work. Called by the human ("refresh context", "re-read the docs", "rebuild the backlog", "освежи контекст", "перечитай доки") AND by the agent itself periodically inside long autonomous loops (nightloop/dayloop) so it doesn't lose the big picture between iterations.
---

# /refresh-context — refresh context and rebuild the backlog

Long autonomous loops and context loss between sessions make the agent lose the big picture. This skill
restores it quickly and forms a current backlog.

## What to do

1. **Re-read strategy & map:**
   - `plans/master_plan.md` — the master plan and phases (where we're going).
   - `plans/project_map.md` — the map of modules/files and data flows (how it's built).

2. **Re-read the KEY guidance docs:**
   - `AGENT_GUIDE.md` — the rules (git workflow, style, tools, build).
   - `STATUS.md` — current state, what's in progress, "where to continue", "awaiting human review".
   - `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` — how to fix bugs.
   - `PHILOSOPHY.md` — the simplicity principle (KISS + Occam).

3. **Walk the backlog and rebuild it:**
   - `ls bugs/` — take everything NOT tagged `DONE` (open bugs).
   - `ls plans/ideas/` — take everything NOT tagged `DONE` (open ideas/features).
   - Glance at `plans/homework_*.md` and `interviews/` — what's waiting on the human (don't take into
     work, but know it).
   - Form the current open-task list (briefly, e.g. in a TodoWrite list).
   - 🧹 **If the backlog hasn't been revised in a while** (closed files without the `DONE` tag have piled
     up) — call `/check-backlog`: it tags genuinely-closed files DONE and returns a clean open list.

4. **Pick one task** from the rebuilt backlog (priority: finish what's started > bugs > new ideas) that
   doesn't need a human decision. If you're in a loop — continue the loop with it.

## Notes
- This is a FAST skill (read + list), a couple of minutes. Don't rewrite docs without need.
- If human-level questions surface — file them in `interviews/` and mark `STATUS.md` "❓ awaiting human review".
- In autoloops, call this once every few iterations, not every iteration.

# /check-backlog — backlog revision (bugs/ and plans/) and DONE tagging

Over time, `bugs/` and `plans/` accumulate files that are DONE but not tagged `DONE` — so the file
listing no longer tells you what's left. This skill tidies up: it collects the current open list AND
tags the genuinely-closed files DONE.

Relies on the `DONE`-tag-in-filename convention (see `AGENT_GUIDE.md` → "Backlog & the DONE tag").

## What to do

1. **Collect all backlog files:**
   - `ls bugs/` — all bug docs.
   - `ls plans/` and `ls plans/ideas/` — ideas/features and worklogs/plans.
   - ⚠️ `plans/` contains REFERENCE docs (not tasks): `master_plan.md`, `project_map.md`, `goal.md`,
     `context.md`, etc. — do NOT tag these DONE; they're living references, not closable tasks. Only tag
     concrete bugs/ideas/features/tasks.

2. **Split into two lists by filename:**
   - **Open (no `DONE` in name)** — candidates for the "to implement" backlog. Note them.
   - **Tagged `DONE`** — already closed, skip.

3. **For EACH open file — determine the real status** (don't guess!):
   - Read the document: is there a status of ✅/CLOSED/IMPLEMENTED/FIXED/PROVEN inside?
   - Cross-check `STATUS.md` and, if needed, the code/`git log` — is it actually done?
   - **If actually DONE and confirmed** → do the DONE tagging (step 4).
   - **If NOT done / partial / research-only (🔧/🟡/🔬)** → leave open, add to the current backlog (with
     a short "what's left").
   - **If unclear** → do NOT tag; leave open and mark "needs verification".

4. **DONE tagging (only for confirmed-closed):**
   - Rename, inserting `DONE` after the number, preserving history:
     `git mv bugs/13_detach_crash.md bugs/13_DONE_detach_crash.md` (don't change the number; format
     `<NN>_DONE_<name>.md`).
   - **Append a status section inside the document**, e.g.:
     ```
     ## ✅ STATUS: DONE (<date>)
     What was done: <short summary of the fix/implementation>.
     How verified: <build/harness/measurement/commit hash/loop iteration>.
     ```
   - Commit (in a loop, by the usual commit discipline; otherwise batch at the end of the revision).

5. **Produce the summary:**
   - A short list of OPEN tasks (the backlog) with priority: finish started > bugs > new ideas.
   - The list of files tagged `DONE` in this revision.
   - Anything left as "needs verification" (unclear status).

## Notes
- Careful revision: tag DONE only what is REALLY closed and verified — better to leave open than to
  wrongly close.
- Reference docs in `plans/` are never DONE-tagged.
- In autoloops and at `/refresh-context`, call this once every few iterations, not every iteration.
- If human-level questions surface — file in `interviews/` + mark `STATUS.md`, don't decide blindly.

name: report-bug
description: File a bug document in bugs/ by the project's rules, when the agent hits a defect during development/testing (a crash, wrong behavior, regression, library defect). The agent keeps its OWN bug backlog — one md per noticed bug, by the canon of the existing bugs/ docs.

---

# /report-bug — file a bug document in bugs/ (the agent keeps its own bug backlog)

Whenever the agent writes code, tests it, and **hits a bug** (crash, wrong behavior, artifact,
regression, library defect), it files a SEPARATE md document in `bugs/` by the same rules as the
existing bug docs. This way the agent accumulates a bug backlog for itself — nothing is lost, and any bug
can be returned to (or handed to `/bug-research`).

> Project rule (`AGENT_GUIDE.md`): "for every bug, even small ones — reflect and capture knowledge in a
> dedicated md in `bugs/`." This skill automates exactly that.

## When to call

- The agent saw a defect during dev/test that it is NOT fixing right now (or is fixing, but wants to
  capture the forensics/postmortem).
- A bug needs to be deferred (take another task) without losing it.
- The human asks to file a bug.
- NOT for a "stuck-from-misunderstanding" stall (that's `PHILOSOPHY.md`) and not instead of fixing a trivial typo.

## What to do

1. **Determine the next number.** `ls bugs/` → max two-digit `NN` + 1. Filename:
   `bugs/NN_<short_english_name>.md` (snake_case, like its neighbors; NO `DONE` tag — the bug is open).

2. **Gather facts BEFORE writing** (don't invent — a bug doc is valuable for its facts):
   - Symptom: what exactly is observed (and how it differs from expected).
   - Repro: deterministic steps. Where possible — via the harness, so the bug reproduces without the human.
   - Forensics: logs / crash file / measurements — attach the key lines (stack, abort message, error
     codes, sizes).
   - Build/version, environment, mode.

3. **Write the document by the canon** (structure like the existing bug docs):
   ```
   # Bug NN — <one-line description>

   **Status:** 🔴 OPEN   (or 🟡 partial / 🔬 research-only / 🔧 fix pending verification)
   **Version/build:** <build>   ·   **When/context:** <date, during which task it was found>

   ## Symptom
   <what is observed>

   ## Repro (deterministic)
   <steps; harness commands if available>

   ## Forensics
   <key logs / crash / measurements>

   ## Root cause / Hypotheses
   <the cause if clear; otherwise ranked hypotheses — do NOT patch blindly>

   ## Fix plan (or the fix, if done)
   <steps; relation to architecture / other bugs>

   ## Links
   <related bugs / ideas / interviews>
   ```
   Follow `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. If the bug is in a third-party library, file a ticket for them (e.g.
   via `gh`) and reference it from the doc.

4. **Record in the backlog/process:**
   - If important/blocking — a short line in `STATUS.md`.
   - Commit (in autoloops, by the usual discipline): `<COMMIT_COMMAND> "docs(bugNN): …"`.

5. **Lifecycle:** while open — file WITHOUT `DONE`. When CONFIRMED closed (fixed and verified) — rename
   `git mv bugs/NN_x.md bugs/NN_DONE_x.md` and append a `## ✅ STATUS: DONE (date)` section (what was
   done / how verified). Backlog revision — the `/check-backlog` skill.

## Notes
- Better to file a bug and leave it open than to lose it. Factual accuracy beats prose.
- If a bug resists (≥3 blind fix attempts) — switch to `/bug-research` (investigation without code) on the same doc.

---

# /bug-research — deep bug investigation without coding

Used when a bug **won't yield to direct attempts** (rule: after **3 failed iterations** of
fix→build→test we stop going blind — see `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`). Random poking wastes time and
builds; stop and UNDERSTAND the cause.

> ⛔ In this skill we do NOT write code, do NOT fix, do NOT build, do NOT run the software. Only reading,
> searching, analysis, reflection, and writing into the bug's md document. Pure cognitive work.

## Step 0. Anchor on the bug

- Open the bug doc in `bugs/NN_*.md` (if none — create one per `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`).
- Briefly write out: the symptom, what's been tried (attempt log), under what conditions it reproduces.
- Tell the human in one line that you're switching to research mode (we stop poking blindly).

## Step 1. Web search — collect a RAW knowledge base

Make several targeted queries (`WebSearch`), then pull the most relevant pages (`WebFetch`). Look in:
library GitHub issues/discussions/wiki, Stack Overflow, Reddit, official docs.

- Phrase queries by exact APIs/classes/symptoms (method names, error texts, versions).
- **Record the raw data VERBATIM** in the bug doc under "Knowledge base — raw search data": quotes from
  maintainers, method signatures, explanations, source links. This is knowledge for future sessions —
  don't paraphrase loosely; preserve facts and links.
- Separately note: **is what we're doing even possible** (sometimes it's a platform/library limitation).

## Step 2. Code analysis — find where the cause is (no edits)

Read and trace the chain related to the bug (data/calls/state). Don't edit — dissect.

- Build the chain (data flow / call flow) from the source of the problem to the symptom; write it down.
- Find suspicious spots: who passes what, where a value is lost/distorted, what assumptions are made.
- Map our attempts against what you learned ("attempt → what it does per the docs → why it didn't help").

> 🧠 Keep `PHILOSOPHY.md` in mind: a stall usually means the SOLUTION is too complex from misunderstanding
> the task, not that the task is hard. Look for the SIMPLE supported path (KISS + Occam). If the
> hypothesis/plan turns bulky — you probably still don't understand the task; restate it in plain words.

## Step 3. Reflection and hypotheses

In the bug doc, state:
- **A root-cause hypothesis** (one or two, justified by steps 1–2).
- **Next steps for a focused coding session** — concrete, testable (which files, which experiment, how to
  verify the result reliably — not "by eye").
- **Open questions for the human**, if the choice of approach is theirs.

## Step 4. Summary in the chat

Briefly: what you found (key facts), the working cause hypothesis, and the proposed plan for the next
coding pass. Do NOT start fixing within this skill — it ends with a ready knowledge base.

## Notes
- A reliable verification method matters more than speed: if a visual check is unreliable, invent an
  objective one (known-shape controls, measurements, size logs) and write it into the doc.
- The skill's goal: turn "it won't work, I'm poking blindly" into "I understand the cause, I have a plan".

description: Propose an idea/feature/improvement that aligns with the project's master plan and the human's vision, filed as a separate md in plans/ideas/ by the accepted rules.

Invoked by the agent when a worthwhile idea arises (including in autoloops) AND by the human ("propose an idea", "file an idea", "propose-idea", "предложи идею", "оформи идею").
---

# /propose-idea — file an idea in plans/ideas/ (for the human's approval)

When the agent gets a worthwhile idea (a feature, a UX/architecture improvement, a tool), it files it as
a SEPARATE md in `plans/ideas/` by the same rules as existing ideas. **An agent's idea is a contribution
to the product VISION, and the vision belongs to the owner (the human).** So such an idea is created with
status "awaiting approval" and is **NOT implemented until the human approves it**.

## When to call

- An idea arises that moves the project toward the goals in `master_plan.md`/`PHILOSOPHY.md` and doesn't
  contradict the human's vision.
- NOT for small technical decisions within an already-approved task (decide those yourself and just do them).
- NOT for questions needing the human's INPUT on work already in progress — that's `/interview` (a
  question), not an idea. The difference: `/interview` = "I need your answer to continue";
  `/propose-idea` = "I propose a NEW direction, evaluate it".

## What to do

1. **Check against the vision BEFORE filing.** Read (or recall) `plans/master_plan.md`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`
   (KISS) and decisions in `interviews/`. The idea must align. If it contradicts / leads astray /
   over-complicates without need — don't propose it (or reframe it simpler).

2. **Determine the next number.** `ls plans/ideas/` → max `NN` + 1. Name:
   `plans/ideas/NN_<short_english_name>.md` (like neighbors; NO `DONE` tag).

3. **Write the document by the canon** (structure like existing ideas):
   ```
   # Idea NN — <name>

   > Source: AI agent (dayloop/nightloop/observation), <date>.
   > Status: ❓ AWAITING HUMAN APPROVAL — an agent idea = an element of the vision; not implemented without approval.

   ## Essence
   <what is proposed, briefly>

   ## Why / what problem it solves
   <the pain/opportunity; for whom>

   ## How it fits the master plan and vision
   <clear tie to master_plan / accepted decisions — why it's "on track", not sideways>

   ## Implementation sketch (KISS)
   <rough approach; reuse of what already exists; scope/risks>

   ## Open questions / what needs the human's answer
   <forks the owner must close>
   ```

4. **Mark for review and do NOT implement:**
   - A line in `STATUS.md`: "❓ awaiting human review: idea NN — <one line>".
   - Commit the document (`<COMMIT_COMMAND> "docs(ideaNN): proposal — …"`).
   - **Do NOT start implementing** until the human explicitly approves. In an autoloop — continue with OTHER tasks.

5. **After the human reacts:**
   - Approved → take it into work (technical decisions inside — yours). After implementing: status ✅ +
     date, and by the DONE-tag convention — `git mv` with the `DONE` tag and a status section inside.
   - Rejected/reframed → reflect their decision in the document (or delete the idea if rejected).

## Notes
- An idea is a PROPOSAL, not permission to act. Discipline: the product vision is shaped by the human.
- Better to gather a few small ideas meaningfully than to breed near-duplicates. Check existing open
  ideas (`ls plans/ideas/`) so you don't duplicate.

description: Interview the human about open questions the agent must NOT decide alone — UI/UX decisions, serious technical forks, choices that define the brand or architecture. A rare event: by default the agent works autonomously.

---

# /interview — interview the owner

This skill captures decisions that **must not be made autonomously** into an md document in
`interviews/` and pauses the work until the human answers.

All interviews live in `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md`.

## When to call (this is a RARE event)

By default the agent works **autonomously** and makes technical decisions with sensible defaults.
Interviews are the exception. Call one ONLY when the question is genuinely the owner's:

- **A UI/UX decision** — how something looks, behaves, feels for the end user. Never make a UI/UX choice
  without confirmation.
- **A serious technical fork** — choosing a library/protocol/architectural approach with long-lived,
  hard-to-reverse consequences.
- **Brand / vision / product priorities** — naming, icon, target platforms, what's in a phase vs. not.

Do NOT call an interview for: small implementation details, variable names, ordinary bug fixes,
refactors, choices between equivalent technical options — decide those yourself and report in the chat.

If unsure "is this the owner's level or mine?", ask: *is it cheap to reverse?* If yes — decide yourself.
If it shapes brand/architecture/UX for the long term — interview.

## Procedure

### Step 1. Preparation (before writing questions)
- Read the context in code/docs — don't ask what you can find out yourself.
- Verify the technical facts that determine which options are even possible (e.g. "can this dialog be
  removed?", "does the library have the needed API?"). A question without verified groundwork is a bad question.
- Look at past interviews (`ls interviews/`) so you don't duplicate accepted decisions and keep one style.

### Step 2. Create the interview document
- Name: `interviews/interview_NNN_<short_topic>.md`, where `NNN` is the next free number
  (`ls interviews/` → max+1, format `004`, `005`, …).
- Template:
  ```markdown
  # Interview #NNN — <Topic>

  > Topic: <one sentence on what this interview is about>
  > Source of the idea: <file/chat, date>
  > Status: **🟡 awaiting the owner's answers**

  ## Context / what I already found in the code
  <briefly: current state + verified technical facts that constrain the options>

  ## QUESTIONS

  ### Q1. <question>
  - **A) (recommended)** <option + why>
  - **B)** <option>
  - **C)** <option, if any>

  **Answer:**

  ### Q2. ...

  ## Proposed implementation plan (after answers)
  <the steps you'll take once the questions are closed>
  ```

### Step 3. Rules for good questions
- **Closed** A/B/C options — not open "what's best?".
- **Recommendation first**, marked `(recommended)` — the owner always has a fast default.
- Each option with a short "why" / trade-off.
- Group: 1–5 questions per interview, no more.
- Don't ask what's already decided in `plans/` or past interviews.

### Step 4. Ask the owner — via the document
The default, autonomy-friendly method: the owner answers **right in the md document** (fills the
"**Answer:**" fields). This keeps the work async — the agent isn't blocked on a synchronous chat.

Sequence:
- Compose `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md` with questions and "**Answer:**" fields.
- Write ONE paragraph in the chat: what you found, the forks, and a link to the document.
- **Pause** the work (so the owner is signaled to come and fill in the answers). Don't guess for them and
  don't proceed blindly on UI/UX/brand/architecture questions.

### Step 5. After the answers
- Write the decisions into the document: change status to `✅ ANSWERS RECEIVED <date>` and add a
  "Decisions" table.
- If the decisions affect the plan/architecture — update `STATUS.md` and the relevant files in `plans/`.
- Proceed to implement per the approved plan (or, if the owner asks to pause — call `/pause`).

## Notes
- Style and language — match the owner's.
- Past interviews are the reference for tone and structure.
- The skill's goal — minimize bothering the owner, but do NOT make their fateful decisions for them.

---

# /release — publish a release to GitHub

The human asks to ship a new version. This is an **irreversible external action** (a public tag +
GitHub Release). Run the routine **in order**; narrate each step in the chat. If a step fails — stop,
show the error, do NOT continue blindly.

> ⚠️ **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED.** Before the publish itself, show the human: which version it'll be
> (current → new), that the tree is clean, that it built. Publish only on their explicit "yes". A release
> = a public tag and Release, unpleasant to roll back. **In autonomous mode (`/autoloop`/loops) do NOT
> publish a release.**

## Step 0. Decide the bump type

Confirm with the human (or confirm the default): patch / minor / major. State the current → new version.

## Step 1. Pre-check the environment (don't release on a dirty/broken tree)

```bash
git status --short          # tree must be CLEAN (except gitignored artifacts)
git branch --show-current   # the release branch (e.g. main)
git pull --rebase           # so the push is fast-forward
gh auth status              # gh logged in (needed for the GitHub Release)
```
If the tree is dirty — commit/sort it out first (`/pause` or your commit tool).

## Step 2. Refresh README (all languages)

Bring `README.md` in line with reality: phase status, working features, instructions. If bilingual, keep
both languages in sync. Don't invent — reflect only what's actually done and verified (cross-check
`STATUS.md` and the closed `bugs/`/`plans/ideas/` `*_DONE_*`).

## Step 3. Regenerate rendered docs

`<Regenerate any rendered artifacts, e.g. README.pdf (node tools/readme-pdf.mjs). For this framework's
own project, also regenerate the self-extracting core: node tools/build-framework.mjs.>`

## Step 4. Control build (before the release)

`<Run the project build (BUILD_COMMAND). It must succeed. This catches errors BEFORE the version bump so
you don't leave a half-released version.>`

## Step 5. Commit the doc/build changes (before the release)

Commit the README/docs updates so the `release: X.Y` commit is a clean version bump:
```bash
<COMMIT_COMMAND> "docs: README for release X.Y"
```

## Step 6. Publish (after the human's confirmation)

`<Run your release flow. If you have a release tool (e.g. tools/release.mjs that bumps the version,
builds, renames the artifact, commits "release: X.Y", tags vX.Y, pushes, and runs gh release create with
auto-notes), run it. Otherwise, do it explicitly:>`
```bash
# bump version (in version.json or your manifest), then:
git commit -am "release: X.Y" && git tag vX.Y && git push && git push --tags
gh release create vX.Y --title "vX.Y" --generate-notes <ARTIFACT(S) if any>
```

## Step 7. Verify and report

```bash
gh release view vX.Y        # the release exists, artifacts attached
git log --oneline -3        # the release commit + tag are visible
```
Report to the human: the version, the release link, what was attached. Done.

## Notes
- Releases bump minor/major; ordinary in-progress commits bump the build/patch.
- If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward) — `git pull --rebase` and retry. On step 6 this is critical:
  a tag may already exist locally — check `git tag` and `git tag -d vX.Y` before retrying.
- NEVER force-push and never delete others' tags/releases. If something goes wrong during publish — stop
  and show the human, don't "fix" it blindly.
- Don't release in autonomous mode — only on the human's explicit request.

# /kaif-fork — snapshot KAIF into the user's own repo & track it

After living in a project, KAIF often evolves far from origin — locally improved, adapted, extended. At
some point the user wants to **own that evolution**: keep developing and versioning *their* KAIF in
*their* repo, no longer bound to the origin's release cadence. This skill does that in one move.

## Procedure

1. **Gather the current KAIF.** Identify everything that constitutes the deployed framework in this
   project (the core/wrapper: guidance docs, `.claude/skills/` or the agent's equivalent, the `kaif/`
   tools, `.kaif/kaif.json`) — **not** the user's project files and **not** the content artifacts
   (those stay in the project).

2. **Create the user's KAIF repo.** With the human's confirmation, create a new GitHub repo under their
   account (e.g. `gh repo create <user>/<their-kaif-name> --public`). Put the snapshot of the framework
   there as its own self-contained KAIF (carry over `FRAMEWORK.md`/`framework/`, tools, README, LICENSE,
   versioning). This becomes the user's origin.

3. **Switch tracking.** Update `.kaif/kaif.json` in the project: set `origin` to the user's new repo and
   `tracking: "fork"`. From now on `/kaif-version` and `/kaif-update` follow the user's fork.

4. **Seed the fork's versioning.** Start the fork's `version.json` from the current version (note it
   descends from origin vX.Y.Z) with today's release date. The fork evolves on its own semver line.

5. **Report & commit.** Tell the human the fork repo URL and that tracking now points to it. Commit the
   `.kaif/kaif.json` change in the project.

## Notes
- This is a branching of lineage: the user's KAIF may diverge from and even surpass the origin.
- To return to the official origin later, use `/kaif-switch-origin` (with a respectful migration).
- Respect attribution: a fork still carries the MIT license and credits KAIF's origin author; the user
  adds themselves as the fork's maintainer.

---

# /kaif-remove — respectful removal of KAIF (partial or full)

Cleanly take KAIF out of a project. The guiding word is **respectful**: the user's own project remains
intact and working — we only remove what KAIF added, surgically.

## Two modes

- **Partial (default)** — remove the framework **core/wrapper** but **keep the content artifacts**:
  `bugs/`, `interviews/`, `plans/ideas/`, homework, and any other knowledge the work produced. The
  agent's accumulated knowledge survives; only the KAIF machinery leaves.
- **Full (`--all` / "полностью")** — remove the core/wrapper **and** the content artifacts. KAIF is
  burned out of the project's history as if it had never been there — leaving only the user's project.

## Procedure

1. **Confirm the mode** with the human (partial vs full) and that they want removal. This is
   destructive-ish — confirm explicitly.

2. **Identify KAIF-owned items** from `.kaif/kaif.json` and the known layout:
   - **Core/wrapper (removed in both modes):** the guidance docs (`AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `PHILOSOPHY.md`,
     `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`, `STATUS.md`), the deployed skills (`.claude/skills/` or the agent's
     equivalent), the `kaif/` tools, `FRAMEWORK.md`/`framework/` if present, `.kaif/`, and the KAIF
     additions to the auto-loaded context file (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`).
   - **Content artifacts (kept in partial, removed in full):** `bugs/`, `interviews/`, `plans/ideas/`,
     `plans/homework_*`, etc.
   - **NEVER touched:** the user's own project files and directories.

3. **Un-wire the npm handles.** Remove the `kaif:*` scripts that KAIF added to the project's
   `package.json` (the block KAIF inserted), leaving the user's own scripts untouched. (`npm run` is no
   longer cluttered with KAIF handles.)

4. **Remove** the identified items per mode. In partial mode, leave a short note (e.g. keep `bugs/` with
   its README) so the artifacts remain self-explanatory without KAIF.

5. **Verify the project still works** (its own build/tests) and **report**: what was removed, what was
   kept, and confirm the project is intact. Commit `chore: remove KAIF (partial|full) — project preserved`.

## Notes
- Default to **partial** unless the human explicitly asks for full — losing accumulated knowledge
  (bug forensics, decisions) is rarely what they want.
- Respect git history: removal is a normal commit; the user can still see KAIF in past history unless
  they choose to rewrite it (we don't rewrite history without an explicit request).

---

# /kaif-switch-origin — return tracking to the official origin

The inverse of `/kaif-fork`. A project that was tracking the user's own KAIF fork can return to the
official origin (`MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF`), reconciling the two lineages respectfully.

## Procedure

1. **Read `.kaif/kaif.json`** — confirm `tracking: "fork"` and note the current (fork) version.
2. **Confirm with the human** — switching lineages can be significant if the fork diverged a lot. Make
   sure they want the official origin's evolution, not their fork's.
3. **Respectful migration to origin:** fetch the official origin's current `FRAMEWORK.md`; diff against
   the deployed (fork-derived) wrapper; apply the same careful 3-way merge as `/kaif-update` — preserve
   local customizations where possible, surface conflicts, **never** touch content artifacts or the
   user's project files.
4. **Switch tracking:** set `origin` back to `https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF` and
   `tracking: "origin"` in `.kaif/kaif.json`; stamp the origin version + date.
5. **Validate, report, commit:** `npm run kaif:check`; summarize what reconciled and any conflicts left;
   commit `chore: switch KAIF tracking to origin vX.Y.Z (DATE)`.

## Notes
- If the fork had valuable improvements, consider contributing them upstream (a PR to the origin) before
  switching, so they aren't lost.
- As always: respectful — the project stays whole and working throughout.

---

# /kaif-update — respectful migration update from origin

A newer KAIF version exists upstream (see `/kaif-version`). This skill brings the project's framework up
to it **respectfully**: it never breaks the user's project, preserves their local customizations, and
keeps every content artifact (`bugs/`, `interviews/`, `plans/ideas/`, homework).

> ⚠️ This changes the framework wrapper. Confirm with the human before applying. Commit first so the
> update is a clean, revertable diff.

## Procedure

1. **Pre-flight.** Read `.kaif/kaif.json` (current version, `origin`, `tracking`). If `tracking` is
   `fork`, confirm the human really wants to pull from the official origin (usually they'd update from
   their fork instead). Ensure the working tree is clean (commit/stash first).

2. **Fetch the target version** from `origin`: the new `FRAMEWORK.md` (and/or the release asset). The
   self-extracting `FRAMEWORK.md` is the single source of truth for what the new version contains.

3. **Diff old → new.** Compare the new framework's guidance docs, skills, and conventions against what's
   deployed. Classify each change: (a) pure framework upgrade (safe to apply), (b) touches a file the
   user customized (needs a careful 3-way merge), (c) new capability (add).

4. **Migrate respectfully:**
   - Apply framework-owned upgrades (skills, guidance-doc templates) — re-derive the deployed wrapper
     from the new `FRAMEWORK.md`, in the project's working language and sphere (see `.kaif/kaif.json`).
   - **Preserve the user's customizations** — where they edited a guidance doc, merge rather than
     overwrite; surface conflicts to the human, don't guess.
   - **Never touch content artifacts** (`bugs/`, `interviews/`, `plans/ideas/`, homework) or the user's
     own project files. Only the KAIF wrapper/core is migrated.
   - Refresh the npm `kaif:*` handles if the new version changed them.

5. **Stamp the new version** in `.kaif/kaif.json` (version, released date). Run `npm run kaif:check`
   (the validator) to confirm the result is well-formed.

6. **Report & commit.** Summarize what changed, what was merged, any conflicts left for the human.
   Commit `chore: update KAIF to vX.Y.Z (DATE)`.

## Notes
- The guiding word is **respectful**: the project must stay whole and working at every step.
- If the migration is large or risky, do it on a branch / behind a clean commit so it's easy to revert.
- A heavily diverged project may be better served by a fork (`/kaif-fork`) than by tracking origin.

---

# /kaif-version — report the deployed KAIF version & check origin for updates

KAIF is deployed (injected) into a project with a specific version. This skill tells the human which
version is in the project and whether a newer one exists upstream.

## What to do

1. **Read the local marker** `.kaif/kaif.json`:
   ```json
   { "framework": "KAIF", "version": "X.Y.Z", "released": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "origin": "https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF", "tracking": "origin", "sphere": "...", "agent": "..." }
   ```
   Report: current version + release date, the `tracking` mode (`origin` or `fork`), the sphere and agent.
   (Equivalent quick command: `npm run kaif:version`.)

2. **Check the origin for a newer release.** Query the latest release/tag of the `origin` repo, e.g.:
   ```bash
   gh release view --repo MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF --json tagName,publishedAt 2>/dev/null \
     || gh api repos/MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name + " " + .published_at'
   ```
   Compare semantic versions (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

3. **Report to the human:**
   - If up to date → say so.
   - If a newer version exists → say which, and offer: *"I see a newer KAIF version (vX.Y.Z, DATE). Want me
     to run a respectful update & migration for this project?"* → if yes, hand off to `/kaif-update`.
   - If `tracking` is `fork` → note that this project follows the user's own KAIF fork, not the official
     origin; origin updates are informational only (see `/kaif-switch-origin` to return to official).

## Notes
- If `.kaif/kaif.json` is missing, KAIF may not be deployed here (or the marker was lost) — say so and
  point to `FRAMEWORK.md` for (re)deployment.
- Read-only skill: it never changes the project. Updates go through `/kaif-update`.
``````


---

## 7. Conventions (cross-cutting rules)

These rules apply to all work and are referenced throughout the guidance docs and skills.

- **The DONE tag.** Closed `bugs/` and `plans/ideas/` files get `DONE` inserted after their number via
  `git mv` (`13_x.md` → `13_DONE_x.md`), plus an appended status section. The file listing alone then
  shows what's open vs. closed. Reference docs are never tagged. (Skill: `/check-backlog`.)
- **Commits.** `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `refactor:` / `ci:` + one line. End every message with a
  `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the agent. Commit small and often — progress is never lost to a crash
  or a context reset.
- **Git workflow.** A simple, effective default (used by this framework's own project): work only in
  `main`, no feature branches; to undo, use git history (`git revert`, `git checkout <hash> -- file`).
  Pick what fits and state it in `AGENT_GUIDE.md` so the agent doesn't improvise.
- **Comment the code.** Comment non-trivial blocks, modules, and important lines — what they do, why, and
  what they connect to. This is for traceability across context-losing sessions.
- **Narrate progress.** Write short natural-language updates in the chat so the human can glance in and
  follow along — even (especially) during autonomous loops.
- **Read fresh logs.** Always check the current time and the log's timestamp before reading — never act on
  stale logs.
- **Absolute dates.** Convert relative dates ("today", "yesterday") to absolute ones in any persisted
  document — a future session has no idea when "today" was.
- **Build your own harness.** Invest in tooling that lets the agent run, observe, and drive the software
  without a human, and verify objectively (not by eye). Every time you do something manually, ask whether
  it should become a one-step command — then add it and document it in `AGENT_GUIDE.md`.
- **Living docs.** Improve `AGENT_GUIDE.md` / `STATUS.md` whenever it would make future autonomous work
  more effective. The agent steers and tunes itself for the next session.

## 8. UNPACKING — step by step (for the AI agent)

> Goal: deploy the framework into the **current target project**, customized to it. Work in order, narrate
> in the chat. This is a one-time bootstrap; afterwards the project is driven by the skills.

**Step 0 — Confirm the target & read the fractal caveat (§1).** Make sure you are unpacking into the
human's project, NOT into the framework's own repository. Derive everything from THIS document only.

**Step 1 — Inspect the target project & choose the working language.** Before writing anything:
- Read the README, the package manifests / build files, and the directory tree.
- Determine: the project name, the build command, the test command / how to run it, the architecture
  (modules/components), the git remote, and the language(s) used.
- Skim `git log` to learn the recent state. Note what already exists vs. what's planned.
- **Ask the owner their preferred working language** for the project's docs (default: English). From here
  on, write **every wrapper document you create (Steps 3–6) in that language**, per *"Localized
  deployment"* in Part 1 — localize prose and each skill's `description:`; keep code, commands, paths, and
  the skills' `name:` ids canonical.
- **Determine the project's sphere** (§12) — programming, science, design, business, … — by inspection
  and/or asking; you'll adapt the deployed terminology to it.
- **Determine the target agent system** (§13) — Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, … (default: Claude
  Code) — to wire context and skills into its conventions.

**Step 2 — Create the directories.**
```
plans/  plans/ideas/  bugs/  interviews/  .claude/skills/
```

**Step 3 — Write the four guidance documents** (from the templates in §4), replacing every `<PLACEHOLDER>`
with the project's real values discovered in Step 1:
- `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` — universal; write verbatim.
- `AGENT_GUIDE.md` — fill in identity, goal, architecture map, build command, test harness, git workflow,
  tools, code style. For owner-level unknowns (brand spelling, license), leave a clearly-marked `TODO` and
  raise them in Step 7.
- `STATUS.md` — seed it with the project's CURRENT real state (from Step 1): what's done, where we are,
  an autonomous backlog pool, and a "where to continue" checklist.

**Step 4 — Write the skills** (from §6 — all of them, including the five `kaif-*` lifecycle skills), one
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` each, verbatim except the command placeholders (`<BUILD_COMMAND>`,
`<COMMIT_COMMAND>`, `<TEST_HARNESS>`) which you replace with the project's real commands. Keep the YAML
frontmatter and the trigger phrases. (For a non-Claude agent, place skill content per the adapter, §13.)

**Step 5 — Seed `plans/`.**
- `master_plan.md` — the roadmap. If the project has a goal/vision doc, distill it; otherwise draft a
  skeleton (vision, principles, phases) and flag it for the owner.
- `project_map.md` — the architecture map, from your Step 1 inspection.

**Step 6 — Wire the auto-loaded context file.** Create or update the file your agent reads automatically:
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` (or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Some agents: `AGENTS.md`.
- Add a top section: *"Before every task, read `AGENT_GUIDE.md` and `STATUS.md`. Think by `PHILOSOPHY.md`.
  Debug by `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. The skills in `.claude/skills/` are your rituals."* Don't duplicate
  the canon — point at it.

**Step 7 — Wire the KAIF lifecycle (§11).** Write `.kaif/kaif.json` (version, released date, `origin`,
`tracking: "origin"`, plus the `sphere` and `agent` you determined). Respectfully add the `kaif:*` handles
to the project's `package.json` (create it if absent), backed by a small `kaif` tool, without disturbing
existing scripts. For a non-Claude agent, apply the matching adapter (§13) and generate the universal
`AGENTS.md` fallback pointing at `AGENT_GUIDE.md`.

**Step 8 — Commit and report.**
- `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: deploy KAIF"` (with the Co-Authored-By trailer).
- Report to the human: the structure you created; the language, sphere, and agent chosen; which `TODO`
  placeholders still need input; and offer `/interview` to close the owner-level questions.

After unpacking, the project is framework-wrapped. The human drives it with `/resume`, `/pause`, the loop
skills, and the rest.

---

## 9. For the human — quick start

**Install (once):**
1. Put `FRAMEWORK.md` in your project root (download it, or `git clone` this repo alongside).
2. In your agent, say: *"Read FRAMEWORK.md and unpack the KAIF framework into this project."*
3. Tell the agent your **preferred working language** (default English) and answer the few owner-level
   questions it raises (it files them as an interview document).

**Daily driving (the skills you'll actually type):**
- `/resume` — start of a work session: the agent reads the state and proposes the next move.
- `/pause` — end of a session: the agent records state, builds, commits, and pushes.
- `/autoloop` — *"work on your own over the backlog."* For when you step away.
- `/dayloop` — *"work continuously, I'm busy."* No time limit; stops when you write.
- `/nightloop` — *"work overnight."* Stops at a wake time or when you write.
- `/report-bug`, `/propose-idea`, `/interview`, `/release` — as the names suggest.

**What you'll get:** an agent that never starts from zero, that you can leave running for hours, that
escalates the decisions that are genuinely yours, and that leaves behind a repository documenting how and
why your project is built — readable by you and by the next agent session alike.

---

## 10. Placeholder reference

When unpacking, replace these throughout the guidance docs and skills:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `<PROJECT_NAME>` / `<SHORT_NAME>` | The project's name / short name. |
| `<AUTHOR>` | The owner (name / handle). |
| `<REPO_URL>` / `<LOCAL_PATH>` | Git remote URL / local project folder. |
| `<LICENSE>` | The project's license. |
| `<BUILD_COMMAND>` | The exact command to build the project. |
| `<TEST_HARNESS>` | How the agent runs/observes/drives the software without a human. |
| `<COMMIT_COMMAND>` | The commit/push flow (a tool, or `git add -A && git commit … && git push`). |
| `<YOUR AGENT/MODEL>` | The Co-Authored-By identity for commits. |

For owner-level unknowns (brand spelling, license choice, target platforms, vision), don't guess — leave a
`TODO` and close it with `/interview`.

---

## 11. Versioning & the KAIF lifecycle

KAIF is **versioned** and has a full lifecycle in a project — not just a one-shot install.

**Version stamp.** Versions are semantic + date-stamped: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (YYYY-MM-DD)`. On deploy the
agent writes `.kaif/kaif.json`, recording the version, release date, `origin` repo, `tracking` mode
(`origin` or `fork`), the project's `sphere`, and the `agent` system:

```json
{ "framework": "KAIF", "version": "1.0.0", "released": "2026-06-30",
  "origin": "https://github.com/MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF", "tracking": "origin",
  "sphere": "programming", "agent": "claude-code" }
```

So the agent always knows which KAIF the project runs and where it came from.

**npm handles.** On deploy, KAIF respectfully adds `kaif:*` scripts to the project's `package.json`
(creating one if absent), backed by a small `kaif` tool — without disturbing existing scripts:
`kaif:version`, `kaif:check`, `kaif:update`, `kaif:fork`, `kaif:switch-origin`, `kaif:remove`,
`kaif:remove-all`. Removing KAIF removes these handles.

**Lifecycle skills** (the five `kaif-*` skills):

- **`/kaif-version`** — report the deployed version; check `origin` for a newer release.
- **`/kaif-update`** — **respectful migration update** from origin. When a newer version appears, the
  agent offers it (*"I see a newer KAIF — run a respectful update & migration?"*); on yes it migrates the
  core, **preserving local customizations and all content artifacts**, never breaking the project.
- **`/kaif-fork`** — snapshot this project's evolved KAIF into the user's **own** repo and switch
  `tracking` to it, so they version their own evolution independently of origin.
- **`/kaif-switch-origin`** — return tracking to the official origin (with a respectful migration).
- **`/kaif-remove`** — **respectful removal**: partial (default — remove the core/wrapper, **keep** the
  content artifacts: bugs, interviews, ideas, homework) or full (`--all` — remove artifacts too). Either
  way the user's own project stays whole and working; KAIF leaves no damage.

Origin = the canonical KAIF (`MikalaiKryvusha/KAIF`), its "DNA." Track it for the project's life, or fork
and evolve your own — KAIF supports both, and switching between them, always respectfully.

## 12. Spheres — adapting to any domain

KAIF is not only for programming. The same method serves mathematics, science, medicine, design,
education, project management, finance, writing, and more. At deploy, the agent determines the project's
**sphere** (inspect + ask), records it in `.kaif/kaif.json`, and adapts the deployed wrapper's
terminology to that domain — what `bugs/`, "release", "build", and "test" *mean* there — using a **sphere
library** (a concise term glossary + an entity mapping + a brief thesis intro to the domain). The repo
ships a reference sphere (`programming`) plus examples (`science`, `design`, `business`) and a `_template`
for authoring any other **on demand** — so KAIF adapts to *your* sphere even if no prebuilt library
exists. If the sphere is unknown, KAIF falls back to neutral wording and still works. Catalog:
`framework/spheres/`.

## 13. Adapters — running on any agent system

KAIF's substance is **agent-agnostic**; only the *wiring* differs per system — (1) where the agent reads
project context, and (2) where it discovers commands/skills. At deploy, the agent determines the target
system, records it in `.kaif/kaif.json`, and uses the matching **adapter** to place `AGENT_GUIDE.md` and
translate the skills into that system's format — always generating a universal `AGENTS.md` fallback that
points at `AGENT_GUIDE.md`. Reference adapter: **Claude Code** (`CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills/`). Priority
systems with adapters: **OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code**; others
(Devin, OpenCode, Aider, Junie) via the `AGENTS.md` fallback or authored from `_template`. Catalog:
`framework/adapters/`.
