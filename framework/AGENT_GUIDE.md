# <PROJECT_NAME> — AI Agent Guide

This file is read by the AI agent before every task. It is the **canon** of the project: the rules,
the map, the commands, the conventions. Keep it accurate — a fresh agent session with empty context
relies entirely on this document to get to work.

> 🧠 **PRIME PRINCIPLE — SIMPLICITY (read `PHILOSOPHY.md`).** If something is taking a long time, it is
> NOT a hard task and NOT a library bug — the agent is DOING IT TOO COMPLEX because it did NOT UNDERSTAND
> THE TASK. Everything should be simple (KISS + Occam). Stuck → re-understand the task, find the
> built-in simple path, do NOT escalate complexity. A stall = "simplify your understanding," not "dig harder."

> 🤖 **AUTONOMOUS MODE.** When the human has stepped away / granted autonomy and there is no active
> interactive task, and `STATUS.md` has an open autonomous backlog — the agent SHOULD, on its own
> initiative, enter the appropriate loop skill (`/autoloop`, `/dayloop`, or `/nightloop`) and grind the
> backlog, committing progress and self-restarting after each task. Stop only on the skill's stop
> conditions. Do not enter a loop if the human just gave a specific interactive task.

## Before every task — checklist

```
1. Read STATUS.md                 # current state: what's done, where we are, what's next
2. Recall experience              # grep EXPERIENCE.md by the task's tags — don't repeat known dead ends (skill: /experience)
3. git status                     # what changed, what's uncommitted
4. git log --oneline -5           # where we are in history
5. Read MEMORY.md (if present)    # user profile, key decisions
6. Load ONLY the relevant slice   # use the Context router below — read the required minimum + task-type docs, not everything
7. Execute by the fable loop      # /fable-method: gates + forced artifacts (INTENT/AUTH/TWINS/PENDING); /fable-loop to orchestrate; /fable-judge before claiming done
8. Read the relevant plan         # plans/<feature>.md, if the task touches a specific feature. Code by citing the plan: before implementing a step, QUOTE the anchor line you are doing right now — if you can't name the line, that's scope drift caught BEFORE the diff
9. Recon before code (external truth)  # the task rests on an external truth (an old/reference system, a foreign API, prod behavior, a vendor doc)? The FIRST artifact is a recon doc in researches/ — code is forbidden until it exists; then code by the document, not from recall. Recon docs are reused by every future session
10. Check the map & blast radius   # before editing code: PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md — who is affected; update the map if relations change
11. Run the build (if touching code)   # <BUILD_COMMAND>
12. Use the test harness          # <TEST_HARNESS> — drive/observe the software without a human
13. Comment the code              # comment blocks, classes, modules, important lines — with a test-status marker: fresh raw content gets [NOT-TESTED]; verified-by-observation flips to [TESTED: date · how] (TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md)
14. Reflect on bugs in bugs/      # one md per bug; follow BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md
15. Capture experience            # after a meaningful success/failure, append a lesson to EXPERIENCE.md (skill: /experience)
16. Periodically re-read the key guidance docs:
    - PHILOSOPHY.md   ← the simplicity principle; if stuck, go here first
    - AGENT_GUIDE.md
    - STATUS.md
    - BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md
    Edit them when it would make future autonomous work more effective. The agent operates across
    sessions that lose context — these docs must let a fresh session get productive from empty context.
17. Narrate in the chat, at least a little, in natural language — what you're doing right now — so the
    human can glance over and follow along.
18. Documents from the human (ideas, bugs, features): FIRST commit the original verbatim (git add +
    commit) — only then, in a following commit, fix typos and minimally restructure into a clean
    structured format for AI consumption (the human's voice and every thought preserved; their original
    wording stays reachable in git history). After implementing from such a document, write the status
    and the implementation date back into it.
```

→ **`STATUS.md`** is the master state file. Update it after every significant task.

### Context router (progressive loading) — read only the slice you need

Don't read every document "just in case" — that fills the context you're trying to protect. Read the
**required minimum** always, then only the documents for the task type; fetch more on demand.

| Task type          | Read (minimum on top of the required minimum)                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Required minimum (always)** | `STATUS.md` · `PHILOSOPHY.md` (the principle set) · this router · `EXPERIENCE.md` (grep by tag) |
| Bug                | `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` · `bugs/<this>` · the map (blast radius)     |
| Testing / verifying anything | `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` (the 7 principles · `[NOT-TESTED]`/`[TESTED]` markers) · the sphere's verification sections |
| Feature / idea     | `ideas/<this>` · `MASTER_PLAN.md` · the relevant `plans/<this>`        |
| Refactor / edit    | `AGENT_GUIDE.md` · the two maps (blast radius)                         |
| Planning           | `MASTER_PLAN.md` · `GOAL.md` · open backlog                            |
| External truth involved (old system / foreign API / prod / vendor doc) | the recon doc in `researches/` — **create it first** if it doesn't exist (checklist step 9) |

Sections in these documents are anchored — address a slice (`DOC.md#anchor`) rather than re-reading the
whole file. The required minimum is **not** subject to laziness: `PHILOSOPHY.md` always applies.

### Recon artifacts — when the task has an external truth

Three artifact types live in `researches/`, each replacing a specific kind of invention with
observation (a session that "remembers" a domain invents it):

- **Recon doc** (checklist step 9) — *describes* how the external truth actually works, read from the
  live source (old system's code, the running prod, the vendor doc) — never from recall. The first
  artifact of any task that rests on one; reused by every future session.
- **Canon map** — for any domain with facts (a game world, a product, a brand, an API): a table of
  entities → their roles → mappings, **approved by the owner**. The map precedes the canon: every edit
  is checked against it, ONLY the owner may change it, and a conflict between text and map = stop and
  ask. Key facts of the map deserve guards (`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards).
- **Parity inventory** — where a reference exists (an old system, a competitor, a brand book): a
  **countable** checklist, one row per element — `element → reference behavior → present in ours? →
  OK/bug`. The rule: **no inventory row — no code**; delivery is judged BY THE ROWS, not by impression.
  A recon doc *describes*; the inventory *counts* — a session can read a description and still invent,
  but it cannot argue with a row.

### Task execution discipline — the fable loop

Any non-trivial task is executed by the **fable-method** loop (`.claude/skills/fable-method/`): classify
the ask → define done → gather evidence → decide → act surgically → verify by observation → report
outcome-first, with its gates and **forced artifacts** (`INTENT:` / `AUTH:` / `TWINS:` / `PENDING:`
lines at decision points — rules at decision points, not rules in lists, are what weak sessions actually
follow). Orchestrated work (parallel evidence fan-out, adversarial verifiers) uses `/fable-loop` — inside
the autonomous cycles, per backlog item. Whenever work is claimed complete (yours or another agent's),
run a **`/fable-judge`** pass before presenting it as done — mandatory in the loops and in `/release`.
These three skills are vendored verbatim from [fable-method](https://github.com/Sahir619/fable-method)
(Sahir619, MIT) — see their headers for the sync ritual; the project's sphere library plays the role of
their domain adapters.

### Languages — two audiences, two languages

Agent-internal documents (this guide, `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`, `STATUS.md`,
`EXPERIENCE.md`, the maps, working notes in `plans/`/`bugs/`/`researches/`, the skills) are written and
maintained in **English** — the language models read most reliably. Owner-facing documents (`GOAL.md`,
`KAIF_FRAMEWORK.md`, the directory READMEs) and every chat report to the owner are in
**<OWNER_LANGUAGE>**. Keep this split as you create new documents.

### Experience log — `EXPERIENCE.md`

`EXPERIENCE.md` is the agent's growing, grep-friendly log of lessons (externalized memory of what works and
what doesn't). **Recall** relevant entries before a task (grep by tag); **capture** a short lesson after any
meaningful success or failure — in loops, do both without waiting for the human. Skill: `/experience`.
Boundary: `bugs/` = one doc per defect; `EXPERIENCE.md` = short cross-task, approach-level lessons (incl.
successes). Living reference — never DONE-tagged.

## Project identity (CANON — use these, don't invent)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name / brand** | `<PROJECT_NAME>` |
| **Short name** | `<SHORT_NAME>` |
| **GitHub repository** | `<REPO_URL>` |
| **Local project folder** | `<LOCAL_PATH>` |
| **Author / owner** | `<AUTHOR>` |
| **License** | `<LICENSE>` |

> Keep one canonical spelling for names/paths/URLs and use it everywhere. If you find an old/renamed
> identifier in historical docs, normalize it to the canonical value above.

---

## Goal of the project

`<ONE-PARAGRAPH STATEMENT OF WHAT THIS PROJECT IS AND FOR WHOM. Keep it short and concrete.>`

---

## Architecture — the map

`<HIGH-LEVEL MODULE/COMPONENT MAP. The directory layout, the modules, and the dependency rules between
them. Keep this in sync with PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md (the detailed map). Example:>`

```
<module-a>      ← entry point / app
<module-b>      ← <responsibility>
<module-c>      ← <responsibility>
```

**RULE:** `<state the key architectural invariant, e.g. "feature modules don't depend on each other">`.

Full file map and data flows live in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md`.

---

## Build

```bash
<BUILD_COMMAND>
```

`<Note any environment gotchas: required toolchain version, env vars (e.g. JAVA_HOME), how to check
for errors only, how to do a headless vs. interactive build.>`

---

## Test harness (how the agent observes & drives the software)

`<Describe the tooling the agent uses to run, observe, and drive the software WITHOUT a human — the
single most important investment for autonomous work. For a GUI app: a UI-automation/inspection tool.
For a server: a request runner + log tail. For a CLI: scripted invocations + golden outputs. Always
prefer deterministic reproduction and objective verification over eyeballing. Grow this tooling over
time and document new commands here.>`

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `<cmd>` | `<...>` |

> Full harness guide: `<path to your harness/automation guide, if any>`.

---

## Git workflow

`<State your branching policy. A simple, effective default — used by this framework's own project —
is: work ONLY in `main`, no feature branches; commit incrementally and often; to undo, use git history
(git revert / git checkout <hash> -- file), not branches. Pick what fits your project and state it here
so the agent doesn't improvise.>`

> Reconciliation with the fable-method **authorization gate**: this deployed guide IS the owner's
> standing authorization for routine commits/pushes per the policy above. Everything beyond it —
> releases, deploys, external sends/publishes, force-pushes, deletions of shared data — still requires
> the owner's quoted words (an `AUTH:` line).

**Non-negotiable git hygiene (each rule exists because its violation burned a real project):**

- **`git diff --stat` before every commit.** Anything in the diff you did not intend to change — STOP
  and explain it first. This includes diffs *your tools* generated (lock files, manifests, formatters):
  an agent trusts its tools even more blindly than itself — read those diffs line by line.
- **Ignore first, then the tool.** Any new tool, export, dump, key, or binary enters the project ONLY
  after its `.gitignore` line exists. A secret caught by a gate is a success of procedure; a secret
  caught by the owner is a failure of the framework.
- **The owner's originals are inviolable.** A document from the owner is committed verbatim BEFORE any
  edit (checklist step 18) — never "improve" an original that isn't safely in history yet.

## Commits

Style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `ci:` + one line of what was done.

**A commit that touches test files carries a justification block:** *why this test changed and what it
now guards*. A test edit without it is fraud by default (`/fable-judge` hunts exactly this — the quiet
fitting of tests to new behavior is the most documented agent failure). After changing behavior, also
answer: could the old tests now pass for the WRONG reason? If yes — rebuild the fixtures so each test
guards what it claims to guard, and say so in the commit.

End every commit message with the co-author trailer:

```
Co-Authored-By: <YOUR AGENT/MODEL> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

`<If you use a commit/version tool (e.g. tools/commit.mjs that bumps a build number, commits, pushes),
document it here.>`

## Push / GitHub authentication

`<Document how pushing and GitHub operations are authenticated in this environment (e.g. `gh auth
setup-git` to use the gh token as a git credential helper), and the recovery steps if a push fails
(non-fast-forward → git pull --rebase → retry).>`

---

## Tools

`<Table of the project's automation tools (build, commit, release, codegen, graphics, etc.). Keep it
current — when you add or extend a tool, add a row here.>`

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `<cmd>` | `<...>` |

---

## Backlog & the DONE tag

So that the file listing alone tells you what's open vs. closed — **insert the word `DONE` into the
filename after the number when a file's task is completed and verified:**

```
bugs/04_modal.md                →  bugs/04_DONE_modal.md
ideas/07_dev_menu.md      →  ideas/07_DONE_dev_menu.md
```

**Rule (do this every time you work with bug/idea files):**
- Finished a bug/idea and it is CONFIRMED closed (status ✅, verified) — rename immediately, inserting
  `DONE` after the number: `git mv <NN>_<name>.md <NN>_DONE_<name>.md`.
- A file in progress / partial / research-only — do NOT mark `DONE` (🔧/🟡/🔬 = not done yet).
- Use `git mv` (preserves history). Don't change the number.
- Reference docs in `plans/` (master_plan, project_map, etc.) are NOT tasks — never tag them DONE.
- **Closing any idea/bug/plan requires a "Decisions made without the owner" section** — every
  micro-decision the agent made solo while executing, and how it chose (or an explicit "none"). An agent
  silently makes dozens of such calls; this section puts them on the owner's table, where a divergence
  from the vision costs one line to fix instead of a rework — and it is the best generator of the
  owner's next questions. Unsettled assumptions (fable `PENDING:` lines) are settled here too: each one
  *confirmed / refuted / asked*, never silently dropped.

**Owner's drive-by notes mid-task go to the backlog, not into a task switch** (idea 17 §2). When the
owner tosses an idea/improvement/bug into the chat while you are working on something ELSE: capture it
as a document right away (`/propose-idea` → `ideas/`, `/report-bug` → `bugs/` — note the source in the
header: "tossed by the owner mid-task, <date>"), confirm in one chat line ("recorded in ideas/NN —
continuing the current task") and return to the interrupted work. Do not drop the current task for the
note, and do not hold it in your head until the session ends — a session's head is the worst storage
there is. Classify first: the note CONCERNS the current task → it is a clarification, apply it; it is
vision-level → `/fix-vision`; it is an explicit "switch to this" → switch.

**A batch of bugs from the owner is one process incident.** When the owner's manual test pass brings a
WAVE of bugs at once, the wave itself is a symptom that the process leaked — worth more than any bug in
it. Fix the bugs; and on the owner's explicit ask ("figure out why so many") open a **process document**
in `plans/` — `owner's verdict (verbatim) → honest diagnosis of the process → remedies as process
changes → steps with checkboxes` — and execute it alongside the fixes. Health metric: the owner's next
wave is SMALLER. If the waves don't shrink, the remedies aren't working — revise them. The goal is not
"zero bugs"; it is "the owner stops finding them in batches."

**Backlog revision skill — `/check-backlog`:** walks `bugs/` and `plans/`, collects everything without a
`DONE` tag as the open backlog, and tags genuinely-closed files DONE (with a status section appended).

**Bug reporting skill — `/report-bug`:** hit a defect during dev/test — file a dedicated md in `bugs/`
by the canon, per `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. The agent keeps its own bug backlog — one doc per defect,
nothing lost.

**Idea proposal skill — `/propose-idea`:** had a worthwhile idea that fits the master plan and the
human's vision — file it as an md in `ideas/` with status "❓ awaiting human approval." An
agent's idea is a contribution to the product VISION → implement ONLY after the human approves.

---

## Decisions the agent must NOT make alone — interviews

Before a significant new feature, and whenever a brand/UX/architecture fork appears, conduct an
**interview** with the human using the `/interview` skill: closed A/B/C questions, recommendation first,
answered by the human directly in `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md`. Never make UI/UX/brand/
architecture decisions without confirmation. Everything else — decide yourself with sensible defaults
and report in the chat.

Rule of thumb: *is it cheap to reverse?* If yes — decide yourself. If it shapes brand/architecture/UX
for the long term — interview.

**Write-gate on the owner's canon artifacts** (rules, lore, brand texts, product docs — anything where
the owner's word IS the content): **new entities** (mechanics, facts, decisions) enter only through a
draft to the owner (interview/chat) and their "yes" — never straight into the canon; **mechanical edits**
under already-accepted decisions (renames, arithmetic, references, notation) go ahead immediately but
stay visible until the owner has reviewed them. Two-stage control: first the *intent* (before writing),
then the *text* (the owner's read-through). Nothing dissolves into the canon silently, and the corridor
for mechanical work stays wide (see the three-doors rule in `PHILOSOPHY.md`).

**Provenance marks — `[AI]…[/AI]` / `[AI-ed]…[/AI-ed]`** (canonical English strings, grep-friendly,
like `[NOT-TESTED]`). Everything the AI writes into the owner's canon artifacts carries a visible
paired mark: `[AI]…[/AI]` — written by the AI; `[AI-ed]…[/AI-ed]` — the owner's text, edited by the AI.
**A mark IS the acceptance queue:** only the owner's word removes it ("the chapter is accepted") — the
agent NEVER unmarks its own text. One mechanism buys three things: *trust* (the owner sees exactly what
is theirs vs. generated — proofreading becomes scanning marks, not rereading everything), *rollback*
(an unaccepted block is safe to remove), and *safety for future agents* (never take unaccepted `[AI]`
text for the owner's canon). The check is grep-cheap: AI text in a canon artifact without a mark — or a
mark removed without the owner's word — is a fraud `/fable-judge` hunts. Mark at write time; tooling
may mechanize the check later, the convention does not depend on it.

Task-level ambiguity (which of two deliverables did the human mean *right now*) is NOT an interview:
per fable-method Step 0, ask exactly **one pointed question** in the chat that states your recommended
interpretation. Interviews are for vision-level forks that outlive the task.

---

## Code style

`<Project-specific code style. A universal baseline:>`
- Comment all non-trivial blocks and modules — what the code does and why, and what it connects to.
  This is for transparency, traceability, and future maintainability across context-losing sessions.
- No magic numbers — named constants with clear names.
- Prefer the platform/library's idiomatic, built-in way over a hand-rolled mechanism.
- **Canonical order for everything compared or cached:** any output that is diffed, deduplicated, or
  cached must be deterministic — sorts with a full tie-break, serialization with sorted keys, no
  `Date.now()`/random in compared output. Nondeterminism never shows in tests and quietly voids diffs
  and caches on live data — this checklist line notices it so you don't have to.
- `<add language/framework-specific rules here>`

---

## Notes from the human

`<Free-form, high-signal guidance from the project owner — the kind of thing that doesn't fit a
category but matters. Examples this framework was distilled from:>`
- Always check the current time and the log file's time before reading logs — read fresh logs, not stale ones.
- Work autonomously without interactive questions. If you need information from the human, write an
  interview document and pause the session (so the human is signaled to come answer), rather than blocking.
- If you find bugs in third-party libraries, file tickets for them via `gh` on the human's behalf.
- Actively test what you build, using whatever tooling lets you drive the software effectively.
- Periodically re-read and, where useful, improve your own guidance docs so a fresh session can be
  effective despite context loss. Steer and tune yourself toward maximum effectiveness and autonomy
  toward the stated goal.
