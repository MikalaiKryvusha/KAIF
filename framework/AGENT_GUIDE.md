# <PROJECT_NAME> — AI Agent Guide

This file is read by the AI agent before every task. It is the **canon** of the project: the rules,
the map, the commands, the conventions. Keep it accurate — a fresh agent session with empty context
relies entirely on this document to get to work.

> 🧠 **PRIME PRINCIPLE — SIMPLICITY (read `PHILOSOPHY.md`).** If something is taking a long time, it is
> NOT a hard task and NOT a library bug — the agent is DOING IT TOO COMPLEX because it did NOT UNDERSTAND
> THE TASK. Everything should be simple (KISS + Occam). Stuck → re-understand the task, find the
> built-in simple path, do NOT escalate complexity. A stall = "simplify your understanding," not "dig harder."

> 🤖 **AUTONOMOUS MODE.** When the human has stepped away / granted autonomy and there is no active
> interactive task, and `STATUS.md` has an open autonomous backlog — the agent SHOULD, on its own
> initiative, enter the appropriate loop skill (`/autoloop`, `/dayloop`, or `/nightloop` — or
> `/guarded-loop` when the owner asked for a protected run) and grind the
> backlog, committing progress and self-restarting after each task. Stop only on the skill's stop
> conditions. Do not enter a loop if the human just gave a specific interactive task.

## Before every task — checklist

```
1. Read STATUS.md                 # current state: what's done, where we are, what's next
2. Recall experience              # grep EXPERIENCE.md by the task's tags — don't repeat known dead ends (skill: /experience)
3. git status                     # what changed, what's uncommitted
4. git log --oneline -5           # where we are in history
5. Read MEMORY.md (if present)    # user profile, key decisions
6. Load ONLY the relevant slice   # use the Context router below — read the required minimum + task-type docs, not everything
7. Execute by the fable loop      # /fable-method: gates + forced artifacts (INTENT/AUTH/TWINS/PENDING); /fable-loop to orchestrate; /fable-judge before claiming done
8. Read the relevant plan         # plans/<feature>.md, if the task touches a specific feature. Code by citing the plan: before implementing a step, QUOTE the anchor line you are doing right now — if you can't name the line, that's scope drift caught BEFORE the diff. A HEAVY task with no plan yet → build the ladder first (Planning discipline below; /plan-task for ordinary work, /plan-epic for epics). Filing a plan/bug/idea → goal vector + acceptance criteria FIRST, per REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md
9. Recon before code (external truth)  # the task rests on an external truth (an old/reference system, a foreign API, prod behavior, a vendor doc)? The FIRST artifact is a recon doc in researches/ — code is forbidden until it exists; then code by the document, not from recall. Recon docs are reused by every future session
10. Check the map & blast radius   # before editing code: PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md — who is affected; update the map if relations change
11. Run the build (if touching code)   # <BUILD_COMMAND>
12. Use the test harness          # <TEST_HARNESS> — drive/observe the software without a human
13. Comment the code              # comment blocks, classes, modules, important lines — with a test-status marker: fresh raw content gets [NOT-TESTED]; verified-by-observation flips to [TESTED: date · how] (TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md)
14. Reflect on bugs in bugs/      # one md per bug; follow BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md
15. Capture experience            # after a meaningful success/failure, append a lesson to EXPERIENCE.md (skill: /experience)
16. Periodically re-read the KEY canon documents — the re-read core (Document taxonomy below;
    triggers & witness — Context refresh below):
    - PHILOSOPHY.md   ← the simplicity principle; if stuck, go here first
    - AGENT_GUIDE.md
    - STATUS.md
    - GOAL.md
    - MASTER_PLAN.md
    - REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md
    - TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md
    - BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md
    - PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md
    Edit them when it would make future autonomous work more effective. The agent operates across
    sessions that lose context — these docs must let a fresh session get productive from empty context.
17. Narrate in the chat, at least a little, in natural language — what you're doing right now — so the
    human can glance over and follow along.
18. Documents from the human (ideas, bugs, features): FIRST commit the original verbatim (git add +
    commit) — only then, in a following commit, fix typos and minimally restructure into a clean
    structured format for AI consumption (the human's voice and every thought preserved; their original
    wording stays reachable in git history). After implementing from such a document, write the status
    and the implementation date back into it.
19. Writing into the owner's artifact?   # text the human signs or reads as their own (docs, paper, site
    copy) → open the owner's voice portrait if one is taken (/owner-voice) and run its checklist before
    handover; no portrait after a second style rejection → propose taking one
```

→ **`STATUS.md`** is the master state file. Update it after every significant task.

### Context router (progressive loading) — read only the slice you need

Don't read every document "just in case" — that fills the context you're trying to protect. Read the
**required minimum** always, then only the documents for the task type; fetch more on demand.

| Task type          | Read (minimum on top of the required minimum)                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Required minimum (always)** | `STATUS.md` · `PHILOSOPHY.md` (the principle set) · this router · `EXPERIENCE.md` (grep by tag) |
| Bug                | `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` · `bugs/<this>` · the map (blast radius)     |
| Testing / verifying anything | `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` (the 7 principles · `[NOT-TESTED]`/`[TESTED]` markers) · the sphere's verification sections |
| Writing requirements / acceptance criteria / a goal vector | `REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md` (the ten criteria · stop-word dictionary · fit criterion) |
| Feature / idea     | `ideas/<this>` · `MASTER_PLAN.md` · the relevant `plans/<this>`        |
| Refactor / edit    | `AGENT_GUIDE.md` · the two maps (blast radius)                         |
| Planning           | `MASTER_PLAN.md` · `GOAL.md` · open backlog · the Planning-discipline section (heavy → `/plan-epic`) |
| External truth involved (old system / foreign API / prod / vendor doc) | the recon doc in `researches/` — **create it first** if it doesn't exist (checklist step 9) |
| Writing into the owner's artifact (text the human signs or reads as their own) | the owner's voice portrait, if one is taken (`/owner-voice`) · the artifact's styleguide |

Sections in these documents are anchored — address a slice (`DOC.md#anchor`) rather than re-reading the
whole file. The required minimum is **not** subject to laziness: `PHILOSOPHY.md` always applies.

### Document taxonomy — the five tiers

Every document in the project sits in exactly one tier; the tier tells the agent what it owes the
document — re-read it, know it, follow its regulation, or leave it alone:

1. **KEY canon documents — the re-read core.** What the agent re-reads regularly and keeps fresh
   in context (checklist step 16; `/resume` reads the full set): `GOAL.md` · `AGENT_GUIDE.md` ·
   `PHILOSOPHY.md` · `REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md` · `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` ·
   `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` · `STATUS.md` · `MASTER_PLAN.md` ·
   `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md`. The key documents reference every other document of the
   framework — having read them, the agent knows what else exists and when to fetch it. NOTE two
   distinct sets: this re-read core (nine) is smaller than the SHIPPED key-document set (fourteen,
   Reference §5) — `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md`, `EXPERIENCE.md` (grepped by tag, never
   re-read whole), `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` (archaeology on demand), `KAIF_FRAMEWORK.md` and
   `KAIF_REFERENCE.md` ship as key documents but are fetched by the context router, not re-read on
   schedule.
2. **EXTENDED canon documents.** The rest of the framework's canon — the internal map, the
   chronicle, the reference, the experience journal, the sphere and adapter libraries. The agent
   may skip them when refreshing context, but knows they exist and works with them when the router
   points there.
3. **WORKING canon documents.** The dynamic documents born under the framework's regulations —
   plans, bugs, ideas, researches, interviews, homeworks, reports. Their form is set by their
   directory README and skill templates; their header — by the header-meta norm below.
4. **OTHER KAIF documents.** The "house rules": local agreements between this owner and the agent
   that modify or extend KAIF in this specific project. Local law — it governs here and travels
   nowhere.
5. **Project working documents.** Everything of the owner's project itself — code, assets,
   documents that are not the framework's. KAIF governs how the agent works on them, not what
   they are.

### Context refresh — the re-read rule and its witness

Rules read once at session start decay as the context fills and compacts — a long session ends up
holding a summary of the canon instead of the canon. The re-read core (tier 1 of the Document
taxonomy above) is therefore RE-READ, not remembered, at four triggers:

1. **The hour:** more than 60 minutes in a live session since the last refresh — refresh at least
   once per hour.
2. **A heavy task:** before starting a task that passes the heaviness test (Planning discipline
   below) in the same long-lived chat.
3. **After compaction / pause:** after a context compaction, a return from `/pause`, or a long
   idle gap.
4. **Ritual points:** `/resume` (the full canon pass), `/refresh-context`, and every iteration of
   the long loops (`/autoloop` · `/dayloop` · `/nightloop` · `/guarded-loop`).

A refresh is a VERIFIABLE ACTION, not a claim — recalling the rule does not prove following it.
The witness has two parts, both mandatory:

- **The marker** — `.kaif/refresh-marker.json`: `{ "at": "<ISO timestamp>", "docs": [<what was
  re-read>], "trigger": "hour|heavy-task|compaction|ritual:<name>" }`, rewritten by the agent at
  the moment of the refresh. Session state, never project history: its `.gitignore` line ships
  with the machinery's ignore-first set. Machine-readable by design — a judge or a hook reads the
  marker's age in one command.
- **The quote-acceptance** — updating the marker is legal ONLY together with quoting in the chat
  one concrete line from the re-read that is relevant to the current task ("refreshed: STATUS
  item 1 — '…'"). The quote proves the reading reached the task; the marker makes the fact
  checkable later.

A marker without the quote — or a claimed refresh with a stale marker — is fraud of the
false-`[TESTED]` class: `/fable-judge` hunts it (the refresh-witness hunt).

### Document header meta — the first screen answers "what is this"

A future session must understand any knowledge-directory document without reading its body. Every
WORKING canon document in `plans/`, `ideas/`, `researches/`, `homeworks/` opens with:

- **Line 1 — H1:** `# <Type> NN — <one-line essence>`.
- **Right after the H1 — a blockquote header** with fixed, lintable labels: **Created:** ISO date
  (plus by whom / on whose word, when it is not the project agent) · **Parent:** the parent or
  source (a plan, an idea, "owner's drive-by note") or `—` · **Status:** the living status WITH
  milestones (phase/step closure dates) · **Outbound:** what from this document must go where
  outside (a decision to the owner · an issue upstream · into a shipped template) or `—`.
  Optional **Descendants:** child documents — lintable when present, never required.

The header is meta, not a chronicle: brief history = milestones in **Status:** plus git history;
a prose changelog in a header is an unlintable drift pair. `bugs/` and `interviews/` keep their
own already-canonical header dialects (the `/report-bug` template header; `Topic:`/`Status:` read
by the questions guard) — one concept, one header, no second canonization. Root key documents
carry self-description as the first block after the H1 instead of the field schema. Each field is
either lintable or it is not in the schema; a header lint consults — it never blocks starting work.

### Contours — the project's large logical modules

A **contour** is a top-level logical module of the system or of the methodology itself — a
complete, closed stack of context on one direction (the update contour, the feedback contour, the
interactive review contour…). Its anatomy has four parts: **boundaries** (what is inside, what is
out) · **governance** (rules, conventions, standards, terminology) · **execution** (workflows,
scenarios, code artifacts, prompts) · **quality control** (done-criteria, obligations, checks).
Working "in contour X", the agent activates that contour's rules and tools and treats it as one
isolated subsystem with clear inputs and outputs. Name contours explicitly and watch their edges:
a contour whose boundary blurs is either reformulated or recorded as conscious debt with a backlog
address — never left unowned.

### Recon artifacts — when the task has an external truth

Three artifact types live in `researches/`, each replacing a specific kind of invention with
observation (a session that "remembers" a domain invents it):

- **Recon doc** (checklist step 9) — *describes* how the external truth actually works, read from the
  live source (old system's code, the running prod, the vendor doc) — never from recall. The first
  artifact of any task that rests on one; reused by every future session.
- **Canon map** — for any domain with facts (a game world, a product, a brand, an API): a table of
  entities → their roles → mappings, **approved by the owner**. The map precedes the canon: every edit
  is checked against it, ONLY the owner may change it, and a conflict between text and map = stop and
  ask. Key facts of the map deserve guards (`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards).
- **Parity inventory** — where a reference exists (an old system, a competitor, a brand book): a
  **countable** checklist, one row per element — `element → reference behavior → present in ours? →
  OK/bug`. The rule: **no inventory row — no code**; delivery is judged BY THE ROWS, not by impression.
  A recon doc *describes*; the inventory *counts* — a session can read a description and still invent,
  but it cannot argue with a row.

Adjacent, but NOT a fourth type: the **owner's voice portrait** (`/owner-voice`). It replaces the same
kind of invention with observation — the owner's own texts instead of a session "remembering" their
style — but it is a CANON document the owner accepts, and it is routed by task type ("writing into the
owner's artifact"), not by external truth.

### Task execution discipline — the fable loop

Any non-trivial task is executed by the **fable-method** loop (`.claude/skills/fable-method/`): classify
the ask → define done → gather evidence → decide → act surgically → verify by observation → report
outcome-first, with its gates and **forced artifacts** (`INTENT:` / `AUTH:` / `TWINS:` / `PENDING:`
lines at decision points — rules at decision points, not rules in lists, are what weak sessions actually
follow). Orchestrated work (parallel evidence fan-out, adversarial verifiers) uses `/fable-loop` — inside
the autonomous cycles, per backlog item. Whenever work is claimed complete (yours or another agent's),
run a **`/fable-judge`** pass before presenting it as done — mandatory in the loops and in `/release`.
These three skills are vendored verbatim from [fable-method](https://github.com/Sahir619/fable-method)
(Sahir619, MIT) — see their headers for the sync ritual; the project's sphere library plays the role of
their domain adapters.

### Planning discipline — the task ladder (`/plan-task` · `/plan-epic`)

Nearly everything in this industry has golden standards, best practices, published research — or at
least documented practitioner lore. **A major epic feature therefore starts with a web recon of the
industry's golden practices and a research doc in `researches/`** — this extends "recon before code"
(checklist step 9) from *external truth* to *industry knowledge*: the state of the art is an external
truth too, and a session that skips the sweep re-invents solved problems badly.

**The heaviness test** (checkable, not taste). A task is HEAVY when **≥2** of these hold:
touches ≥3 subsystems or canon documents · rests on an external truth or an industry standard ·
does not fit one session · changes shipped composition or public contracts · needs owner-level
decisions. Otherwise it is ordinary.

- **Ordinary → `/plan-task`:** ONE operational plan — goal, done-criteria, steps with checkboxes,
  verification-by-observation, risks. Small enough? The plan lives as a section right inside the
  idea/bug document itself. Ceremony must never outweigh the work.
- **Heavy → `/plan-epic`** — the full ladder, each rung an artifact:
  1. **Research** — industry sweep (web) + local recon + the project's requirements, synthesized
     into a research doc in `researches/`. No code, no meta-plan before it exists.
  2. **Meta-plan** — one epic plan in `plans/`: phases, order, gates, acceptance criteria;
     vision-level forks go to `/interview` (work on unblocked phases proceeds meanwhile).
  3. **Operational plans per phase** — R&D · testing · mock-ups · development · debugging ·
     acceptance. Detail ONLY the next phase; the plan for phase N+1 is written when phase N closes —
     never all upfront (they would be fiction by the time you reach them).
  4. **Trace** — every operational step cites its meta-plan anchor line (the citing rule of
     checklist step 8); a step you cannot anchor is scope drift caught before the diff.

The ladder is not ceremony for its own sake: research is where the epic gets its evidence base,
the meta-plan is where the owner sees the whole shape once, and phase-by-phase operational plans are
what keeps a context-losing session executing the RIGHT next step instead of re-deriving the epic.

### Languages — two audiences, two languages

Agent-internal documents (this guide, `PHILOSOPHY.md`, `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`, `STATUS.md`,
`EXPERIENCE.md`, the maps, working notes in `plans/`/`bugs/`/`researches/`, the skills) are written and
maintained in **English** — the language models read most reliably. Owner-facing documents (`GOAL.md`,
`KAIF_FRAMEWORK.md`, the directory READMEs) and every chat report to the owner are in
**<OWNER_LANGUAGE>**. Keep this split as you create new documents.

### Experience log — `EXPERIENCE.md`

`EXPERIENCE.md` is the agent's growing, grep-friendly log of lessons (externalized memory of what works and
what doesn't). **Recall** relevant entries before a task (grep by tag); **capture** a short lesson after any
meaningful success or failure — in loops, do both without waiting for the human. Skill: `/experience`.
Boundary: `bugs/` = one doc per defect; `EXPERIENCE.md` = short cross-task, approach-level lessons (incl.
successes). Living reference — never DONE-tagged.

## Project identity (CANON — use these, don't invent)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name / brand** | `<PROJECT_NAME>` |
| **Short name** | `<SHORT_NAME>` |
| **GitHub repository** | `<REPO_URL>` |
| **Local project folder** | `<LOCAL_PATH>` |
| **Author / owner** | `<AUTHOR>` |
| **License** | `<LICENSE>` |

> Keep one canonical spelling for names/paths/URLs and use it everywhere. If you find an old/renamed
> identifier in historical docs, normalize it to the canonical value above.

---

## Goal of the project

`<ONE-PARAGRAPH STATEMENT OF WHAT THIS PROJECT IS AND FOR WHOM. Keep it short and concrete.>`

---

## Architecture — the map

`<HIGH-LEVEL MODULE/COMPONENT MAP. The directory layout, the modules, and the dependency rules between
them. Keep this in sync with PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md (the detailed map). Example:>`

```
<module-a>      ← entry point / app
<module-b>      ← <responsibility>
<module-c>      ← <responsibility>
```

**RULE:** `<state the key architectural invariant, e.g. "feature modules don't depend on each other">`.

Full file map and data flows live in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md`.

---

## Build

```bash
<BUILD_COMMAND>
```

`<Note any environment gotchas: required toolchain version, env vars (e.g. JAVA_HOME), how to check
for errors only, how to do a headless vs. interactive build.>`

---

## Test harness (how the agent observes & drives the software)

`<Describe the tooling the agent uses to run, observe, and drive the software WITHOUT a human — the
single most important investment for autonomous work. For a GUI app: a UI-automation/inspection tool.
For a server: a request runner + log tail. For a CLI: scripted invocations + golden outputs. Always
prefer deterministic reproduction and objective verification over eyeballing. Grow this tooling over
time and document new commands here.>`

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `<cmd>` | `<...>` |

> Full harness guide: `<path to your harness/automation guide, if any>`.

---

## Git workflow

`<State your branching policy. A simple, effective default — used by this framework's own project —
is: work ONLY in `main`, no feature branches; commit incrementally and often; to undo, use git history
(git revert / git checkout <hash> -- file), not branches. Pick what fits your project and state it here
so the agent doesn't improvise.>`

> Reconciliation with the fable-method **authorization gate**: this deployed guide IS the owner's
> standing authorization for routine commits/pushes per the policy above. Everything beyond it —
> releases, deploys, external sends/publishes, force-pushes, deletions of shared data — still requires
> the owner's quoted words (an `AUTH:` line).

**Non-negotiable git hygiene (each rule exists because its violation burned a real project):**

- **`git diff --stat` before every commit.** Anything in the diff you did not intend to change — STOP
  and explain it first. This includes diffs *your tools* generated (lock files, manifests, formatters):
  an agent trusts its tools even more blindly than itself — read those diffs line by line.
- **Ignore first, then the tool.** Any new tool, export, dump, key, or binary enters the project ONLY
  after its `.gitignore` line exists. A secret caught by a gate is a success of procedure; a secret
  caught by the owner is a failure of the framework.
- **The owner's originals are inviolable.** A document from the owner is committed verbatim BEFORE any
  edit (checklist step 18) — never "improve" an original that isn't safely in history yet.

## Commits

Style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `ci:` + one line of what was done.

**A commit that touches test files carries a justification block:** *why this test changed and what it
now guards*. A test edit without it is fraud by default (`/fable-judge` hunts exactly this — the quiet
fitting of tests to new behavior is the most documented agent failure). After changing behavior, also
answer: could the old tests now pass for the WRONG reason? If yes — rebuild the fixtures so each test
guards what it claims to guard, and say so in the commit.

End every commit message with the co-author trailer:

```
Co-Authored-By: <YOUR AGENT/MODEL> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

`<If you use a commit/version tool (e.g. tools/commit.mjs that bumps a build number, commits, pushes),
document it here.>`

## Document & text hygiene (field-paid rules)

**Each document answers its own question — and takes its shape from its own kin.** README: *"what
is this and how do I use it"* (the product, present tense). Release notes: *"what changed in THIS
version, do I upgrade"* (strictly the delta; anything general is a LINK to the README — the
mechanical check: a paragraph pasteable into the README unchanged belongs in the README).
`STATUS.md`: *"where are we now"* — the living SUMMARY of the present (soft target ~200 lines;
`check` warns above it). `PROJECT_HISTORY.md`: *"the closed past"* — the append-only chronicle:
closed sessions/phases/releases MOVE there verbatim (the `/end-chat` bonsai trim) instead of piling
up in STATUS. `EXPERIENCE.md` and the knowledge dirs: *"why / how it went"*.
Updating the README — draw on the current README and the owner's other repo storefronts (one
storefront handwriting, not the agent's); updating the notes — draw on THIS project's previous
notes (`gh release view <prev>`). Mixing these scopes is a defect, not a style choice.

**TEXT TRAVELS THROUGH FILES, NEVER THROUGH COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS.** Feeding a tool Cyrillic (or
any non-ASCII), curly quotes, emoji, multi-line content, markdown, JSON? Write a UTF-8 file and
pass the PATH. No `python -c "…text…"`, no `-m "…"`, no `echo "…" > file` with non-ASCII. One
class, four unlike faces — recognize it BY SYMPTOM, they hit every Windows project (and face 3
reproduces in JS/JSON/YAML anywhere):

1. `python -c` + non-ASCII → `SyntaxError: (unicode error)` — or WORSE, silent mojibake written to
   the file (the console encoding corrupts the argument before the program sees it);
2. backticks inside double quotes → the shell's command substitution eats chunks of text, prints
   "ok", and the document gets HOLES — no error at all; caught only by reading the result back;
3. Windows paths inside strings → `truncated \uXXXX escape` (`\w`, `\u` read as escapes);
4. different shells are different worlds: GNU tar takes `D:\…` for a remote host while bsdtar
   doesn't; a Git-Bash `/tmp` file is invisible to Windows Python; PowerShell 5 `Set-Content`
   writes ANSI by default. Know WHICH shell you are in; before running a foreign script on
   Windows, check what `tar`/`curl`/`find` actually resolve to in the current PATH; record in the
   project docs which shell the build runs from.

Companions: after ANY machine edit of a non-ASCII document — READ THE RESULT BACK (face 2 cannot be
caught otherwise); prefer the file tools (Write/Edit) over the shell for editing text — the shell
runs processes, it does not carry content.

**The truth↔mirror pairs registry.** The costliest field defects were not complex code but DRIFT
between a source of truth and its mirror: a deploy manifest pinning an old engine version while
prod ran a newer one, a comment contradicting the compose file it describes, a producer's contract
diverging from its consumer. A weak session updates the side it SEES and does not know the other
side exists. Keep a light registry — a table, one row per pair:
`truth → mirror(s) → the one-line check command`. `/end-chat` and `/release` run the registry's
commands and stop on drift; any new "X must match Y" enters the registry the day it is born.
A mirrored/generated surface is edited at its SOURCE and rebuilt — never patched in place (the
patch dies on the next rebuild, and the pair drifts again).
Drift is caught only by CHECKING PAIRS — never by reading one file, however carefully.

## Push / GitHub authentication

`<Document how pushing and GitHub operations are authenticated in this environment (e.g. `gh auth
setup-git` to use the gh token as a git credential helper), and the recovery steps if a push fails
(non-fast-forward → git pull --rebase → retry).>`

---

## Tools

`<Table of the project's automation tools (build, commit, release, codegen, graphics, etc.). Keep it
current — when you add or extend a tool, add a row here.>`

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `<cmd>` | `<...>` |

---

## Backlog & the DONE tag

So that the file listing alone tells you what's open vs. closed — **insert the word `DONE` into the
filename after the number when a file's task is completed and verified:**

```
bugs/04_modal.md                →  bugs/04_DONE_modal.md
ideas/07_dev_menu.md      →  ideas/07_DONE_dev_menu.md
```

**Rule (do this every time you work with bug/idea files):**
- Finished a bug/idea and it is CONFIRMED closed (status ✅, verified) — rename immediately, inserting
  `DONE` after the number: `git mv <NN>_<name>.md <NN>_DONE_<name>.md`.
- A file in progress / partial / research-only — do NOT mark `DONE` (🔧/🟡/🔬 = not done yet).
- Use `git mv` (preserves history). Don't change the number.
- Reference docs in `plans/` (master_plan, project_map, etc.) are NOT tasks — never tag them DONE.
- **Closing any idea/bug/plan requires a "Decisions made without the owner" section** — every
  micro-decision the agent made solo while executing, and how it chose (or an explicit "none"). An agent
  silently makes dozens of such calls; this section puts them on the owner's table, where a divergence
  from the vision costs one line to fix instead of a rework — and it is the best generator of the
  owner's next questions. Unsettled assumptions (fable `PENDING:` lines) are settled here too: each one
  *confirmed / refuted / asked*, never silently dropped.

**Owner's drive-by notes mid-task go to the backlog, not into a task switch.** When the
owner tosses an idea/improvement/bug into the chat while you are working on something ELSE: capture it
as a document right away (`/propose-idea` → `ideas/`, `/report-bug` → `bugs/` — note the source in the
header: "tossed by the owner mid-task, <date>"), confirm in one chat line ("recorded in ideas/NN —
continuing the current task") and return to the interrupted work. Do not drop the current task for the
note, and do not hold it in your head until the session ends — a session's head is the worst storage
there is. Classify first: the note CONCERNS the current task → it is a clarification, apply it; it is
vision-level → `/fix-vision`; it is an explicit "switch to this" → switch.

**A batch of bugs from the owner is one process incident.** When the owner's manual test pass brings a
WAVE of bugs at once, the wave itself is a symptom that the process leaked — worth more than any bug in
it. Fix the bugs; and on the owner's explicit ask ("figure out why so many") open a **process document**
in `plans/` — `owner's verdict (verbatim) → honest diagnosis of the process → remedies as process
changes → steps with checkboxes` — and execute it alongside the fixes. Health metric: the owner's next
wave is SMALLER. If the waves don't shrink, the remedies aren't working — revise them. The goal is not
"zero bugs"; it is "the owner stops finding them in batches."

**Backlog revision skill — `/check-backlog`:** walks `bugs/` and `plans/`, collects everything without a
`DONE` tag as the open backlog, and tags genuinely-closed files DONE (with a status section appended).

**Bug reporting skill — `/report-bug`:** hit a defect during dev/test — file a dedicated md in `bugs/`
by the canon, per `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. The agent keeps its own bug backlog — one doc per defect,
nothing lost.

**A defect in KAIF ITSELF — the five-step contour** (an owner's field decision, adopted as canon:
*"if the AI agent noticed a defect in the KAIF work methodology, fix it in the local KAIF — and file
a bug report to the neighboring KAIF project, to the AI agent developing KAIF; it will then be fixed
in KAIF in a coming update"*). When the rake exists because of how the framework itself is worded or
behaves — not because of this project's code:

1. **Prove it is a CLASS, not a one-off:** reproduce it deterministically and search where else the
   same mechanism bites (the twin check; neighbor deployments on disk are read-only evidence — never
   edit them).
2. **Fix it LOCALLY, without waiting for upstream:** patch the deployed wrapper here (the doc, skill
   or guardrail that misled you); a guard born from the fix is proved by mutation — it must go red on
   the broken version first (`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards).
3. **File the signal** — skill `/report-bug`, its framework branch: `bugs/KAIF/` by template A (bug
   report) / B (improvement request), dedup attestation first; delivery follows the deployment's
   tracking mode (origin — on the owner's behalf through the send gate; anonymous — local only,
   never reach for the origin).
4. **Point the ticket at the local fix** (its "Local remediation" field): your local divergence and
   the upstream fix must be reconcilable at the next `/kaif-update` — a noted divergence is a merge
   the update sees coming; a silent one is a conflict it steps into.
5. **Close the loop at home:** capture the reusable lesson in `EXPERIENCE.md` (skill `/experience` —
   the same discipline as after any meaningful failure), keep the defect visible in `bugs/KAIF/`
   until an update actually retires it, and add a `STATUS.md` line if it changes how the next
   session works.

**Proposing principles — a standing order.** The owner of KAIF explicitly directs deployed agents
to bring new methodologies, principles, standards and frameworks into KAIF when they are GENUINELY
battle-tested by real-world production use — and to recommend retiring what does not work in
practice and only gets in the way (`PHILOSOPHY.md` → "The principle set is battle-tested, not
sacred"). The channel is the same feedback loop: an improvement request (skill `/report-bug`,
template B) whose field evidence names where the practice is proven (projects, hours, sources);
the fate of every proposal is the KAIF owner's decision — the framework's vision belongs to its
author. The frame is blameless: a weak model's failure is a signal of a missing guardrail, never
"the model is dumb".

**Idea proposal skill — `/propose-idea`:** had a worthwhile idea that fits the master plan and the
human's vision — file it as an md in `ideas/` with status "❓ awaiting human approval." An
agent's idea is a contribution to the product VISION → implement ONLY after the human approves.

## Decisions the agent must NOT make alone — interviews

Before a significant new feature, and whenever a brand/UX/architecture fork appears, conduct an
**interview** with the human using the `/interview` skill: closed A/B/C questions, recommendation first,
answered by the human directly in `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md`. Never make UI/UX/brand/
architecture decisions without confirmation. Everything else — decide yourself with sensible defaults
and report in the chat.

Rule of thumb: *is it cheap to reverse?* If yes — decide yourself. If it shapes brand/architecture/UX
for the long term — interview.

**The place of questions — a hard rule.** Everything the agent wants FROM the owner — a fork, a
review, an approval, an answer — lives ONLY in `interviews/` (or an explicitly named decision-queue
document), never in the tail of a plan, research, or bug file. The one exception stays: the single
pointed task-level question in chat (above). Field fact: this rule gets broken even by agents that
KNOW it — chat is cheaper in the moment — so a project that adopts the practice keeps a mechanical
guard ("no unanswered questions outside interviews; every interview carries a status"; a guard of a
text rule runs ~10 false hits per real one — exceptions are explicit, with the reason on the line),
and a tool counts as ADOPTED only when a ritual contains the executable command that shows
violations ("show all unanswered interviews") — in the field such a guard surfaced two questions
nobody saw, hanging 5 and 13 days. The optional interactive contour on top (HTML render of an
interview, recorded one-click decisions) is `/owner-reviews`; an answer's force never depends on
the transport (equivalence rule in `/interview`: HTML = md = chat).

**Showing is an action, not a link.** Whatever the agent wants the human to PERCEIVE — a recon
doc, a report, a render, a PDF, a mockup, an image, a sound — the agent OPENS ITSELF. For the
agent the work feels shown when the artifact EXISTS; for the human it is shown when it is BEFORE
THEIR EYES, and the action between those two states belongs to the agent, who knows the path and
the command (the owner doesn't and shouldn't). "Lies at path…", "opens by double-click", "see
file X" addressed to the human are banned as a way of showing; name the path AFTER the show, as a
footnote of where it landed — never as an errand. No separate show tool: the review contour opens
any markdown (the show contour = the question contour, `/owner-reviews` I15–I17); without the
contour, open the file with the system opener. The rule is guarded mechanically — grep your own
reply for "double-click / opens offline / see file / lies at" next to an artifact extension: a
hit means the show was replaced by a link. Field words that paid for this rule: "I will NOT open
it by double-click! You are forcing me to dig through project files again!"

**The taste class — a criterion the agent cannot measure.** The canon covers measurable criteria
(verify by observation, `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`) and vision forks (`/interview`) — and between them
lies a third class: the acceptance criterion is a PERCEPTION adjective (beautiful, natural,
pleasant, readable, "feels right") — grep-detectable in the ask. There the agent does not conclude;
it **produces a MOCK-UP and files homework**: find the live best candidates → mock them QUICKLY on
OUR OWN material → hand the human an ARTIFACT to perceive (never a link, never someone else's
benchmark — a human judging sound needs sound, not a score; in the field both suggested demo URLs
turned out dead) → record the verdict as canon (the owner's taste is not re-litigated by the
agent). Comparison contract: all candidates on ONE same material, blind labels, the key stored
beside them. The homework doc carries two standing fields: *"ready to see/hear right now"* (paths
to artifacts) and *"verdicts already given"* (so no verdict is ever asked twice).

**Action permission ≠ identity authorship.** A blanket "go ahead, don't ask me" removes
confirmation FRICTION on actions; it never transfers authorship of IDENTITY — naming: release
codenames, product and feature names, slogans, any brand string a human reads first (the test: it
is read first and says how the product presents itself). Identity is NEVER the agent's decision,
under any breadth of approval — a wide "yes" quietly disguises a taste question as a technical
detail of shipping, which is exactly how the field incident happened. The right move under blanket
approval: do everything else and ask ONE pointed question about the name. The fallback: ship under
a neutral factual title — never a placeholder name (still a name someone must un-decide). Every
shipped name carries a source artifact (*owner · channel · date*), and a brand mistake is fixed
only by the owner — un-naming is a brand decision too. (`/release` Step 0 enforces this at the
decision point; `/fable-judge` hunts a shipped name with no source artifact.)

**Write-gate on the owner's canon artifacts** (rules, lore, brand texts, product docs — anything where
the owner's word IS the content): **new entities** (mechanics, facts, decisions) enter only through a
draft to the owner (interview/chat) and their "yes" — never straight into the canon; **mechanical edits**
under already-accepted decisions (renames, arithmetic, references, notation) go ahead immediately but
stay visible until the owner has reviewed them. Two-stage control: first the *intent* (before writing),
then the *text* (the owner's read-through). Nothing dissolves into the canon silently, and the corridor
for mechanical work stays wide (see the three-doors rule in `PHILOSOPHY.md`).

**Provenance marks — `[AI]…[/AI]` / `[AI-ed]…[/AI-ed]`** (canonical English strings, grep-friendly,
like `[NOT-TESTED]`). Everything the AI writes into the owner's canon artifacts carries a visible
paired mark: `[AI]…[/AI]` — written by the AI; `[AI-ed]…[/AI-ed]` — the owner's text, edited by the AI.
**A mark IS the acceptance queue:** only the owner's word removes it ("the chapter is accepted") — the
agent NEVER unmarks its own text. One mechanism buys three things: *trust* (the owner sees exactly what
is theirs vs. generated — proofreading becomes scanning marks, not rereading everything), *rollback*
(an unaccepted block is safe to remove), and *safety for future agents* (never take unaccepted `[AI]`
text for the owner's canon). The check is grep-cheap: AI text in a canon artifact without a mark — or a
mark removed without the owner's word — is a fraud `/fable-judge` hunts. Mark at write time. The check
IS mechanized (optional module, shipped): declare the canon in `.kaif/kaif.json`
(`"canonArtifacts": ["rules/", …]`) and wire `node .kaif/tools/kaif-provenance.mjs check` into your
gates — pair integrity + marks-only-in-declared-canon; `report` lists blocks awaiting acceptance;
`accept <file>` strips marks into the registry and carries the OWNER'S word only.

**Strictness modes — slow is fine when it is visible.** Name the mode a piece of writing runs under:
- **draft** — fast, OUTSIDE the owner's canon: sketches, research notes, ideas, spikes. No
  styleguide, no marks, no canon linter — cheap by design. A draft never silently becomes canon.
- **canon** — anything entering the owner's canon artifacts walks the full pipeline: approved
  styleguide (`/derive-styleguide`) → write with provenance marks → canon linter green
  (`.kaif/tools/kaif-canon-lint.mjs check`, guards proven by `selftest`) → provenance gate green →
  the owner's acceptance.
Model split (mark it in skills and task items): mechanical steps — running linters and gates,
renames, arithmetic, re-syncs — any model; judgment steps — deriving the styleguide, canon wording,
acceptance calls — a strong model only. Everything machine-checkable is checked by CODE; LLMs keep
the judgment.

Task-level ambiguity (which of two deliverables did the human mean *right now*) is NOT an interview:
per fable-method Step 0, ask exactly **one pointed question** in the chat that states your recommended
interpretation. Interviews are for vision-level forks that outlive the task.

## Code style

`<Project-specific code style. A universal baseline:>`
- Comment all non-trivial blocks and modules — what the code does and why, and what it connects to.
  This is for transparency, traceability, and future maintainability across context-losing sessions.
- No magic numbers — named constants with clear names.
- Prefer the platform/library's idiomatic, built-in way over a hand-rolled mechanism.
- **Canonical order for everything compared or cached:** any output that is diffed, deduplicated, or
  cached must be deterministic — sorts with a full tie-break, serialization with sorted keys, no
  `Date.now()`/random in compared output. Nondeterminism never shows in tests and quietly voids diffs
  and caches on live data — this checklist line notices it so you don't have to.
- `<add language/framework-specific rules here>`

## Notes from the human

`<Free-form, high-signal guidance from the project owner — the kind of thing that doesn't fit a
category but matters. Examples this framework was distilled from:>`
- Always check the current time and the log file's time before reading logs — read fresh logs, not stale ones.
- Work autonomously without interactive questions. If you need information from the human, write an
  interview document and pause the session (so the human is signaled to come answer), rather than blocking.
- If you find bugs in third-party libraries, file tickets for them via `gh` on the human's behalf.
- Actively test what you build, using whatever tooling lets you drive the software effectively.
- Periodically re-read and, where useful, improve your own guidance docs so a fresh session can be
  effective despite context loss. Steer and tune yourself toward maximum effectiveness and autonomy
  toward the stated goal.
