# EXPERIENCE — the agent's accumulated experience

> The agent's growing log of lessons. **Externalized memory of *what works and what doesn't*** — so a
> fresh, context-less session (or an autonomous loop) never repeats a dead end. Consult it BEFORE a task;
> append to it AFTER a meaningful attempt (success **or** failure). Grep, don't scroll.
>
> **Tags live inline on every entry** (not in a central list) — so one grep finds the experiences directly:
> `grep '#loop' EXPERIENCE.md` · `grep -i '#context\|#build' EXPERIENCE.md` · `grep '❌' -A4 EXPERIENCE.md`
> · `grep 'EXP-0007' EXPERIENCE.md`. Reuse an existing tag where one fits (grep to see what's in use).
>
> **Entry format (keep it short and grep-friendly).** Newest on top. Every entry starts with a stable id,
> an ISO date, an outcome marker (`✅` / `❌` / `❌→✅`), and inline `#tags`:
>
> ```
> ### EXP-0001 · 2026-01-01 · ✅ · #tag #area
> **Context:** one line — what was being done.
> **Tried / did:** the approach, briefly.
> **Result:** ✅/❌ — what happened.
> **Lesson:** the reusable takeaway (the reason this entry exists).   → link: bugs/NN · ideas/NN · plans/NN
> **Repro:** the ready-to-run command/check that verifies or applies the lesson — a weak session
>   executes a pasted command reliably, an essay it won't act on. REQUIRED since 2.1: a lesson
>   with no Repro line is not accepted (field-proven: lessons with a Repro command get executed,
>   essay-lessons get read and ignored). If the lesson genuinely has no command, say what to
>   OBSERVE instead — but say it as an action.
> **Trigger:** for class-level lessons — the decision point that must invoke this lesson, as
>   "writing X → run Y" (the lesson names WHERE it applies, instead of hoping to be remembered).
> **Not for:** the lesson's validity range — where it does NOT apply. A documented lesson is still a
>   hypothesis; applied outside its range it kills good ideas.
> ```
>
> **A lesson that repeats is a lesson that failed as text.** When the same class recurs in NEW code
> after its entry was recorded, the journal has proven insufficient — the lesson MUST become
> executable (a linter rule, a guard, a gate), and the entry gains the line
> `mechanized: <the tool>`. Two strikes → a mechanism, never a third reminder.
>
> The `#tags` are **trigger-tags**: before a task, grep by the task's tags and QUOTE the relevant
> lessons in your report (id + one line) — or state "no relevant lessons". An unquoted recall is
> unverifiable; `/fable-judge` checks for this line.
>
> Skill: `/experience` (capture a lesson · recall relevant lessons).

## Entries

### EXP-0001 · 2026-01-01 · ✅ · #example #meta
**Context:** first task after KAIF was deployed into this project (example entry — replace with real ones).
**Tried / did:** wrote the first real lesson here in the canonical format.
**Result:** ✅ — the experience log is live and greppable.
**Lesson:** capture lessons at the level of *approach* (what worked / what to avoid), not defect detail
(that lives in `bugs/`); one short entry beats a long story.   → link: (none)
