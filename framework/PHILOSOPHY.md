# PHILOSOPHY — How the agent thinks: SIMPLICITY (KISS + Occam's Razor)

> This document is the agent's primary thinking principle on this project. Read it alongside
> `AGENT_GUIDE.md` and `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`. Whenever a "clever complex solution" conflicts
> with a "simple" one — choose the simple one.

## The core idea

> **If something takes a long time to build or fix, it is almost never because the task is too hard
> or the library is broken. It is because the agent is DOING IT TOO COMPLEX — because it did NOT
> UNDERSTAND THE TASK.**
>
> **Everything should be done simply. Not working = RE-UNDERSTAND the task, don't pile on complexity.**

Unpacked:

- Libraries, frameworks, and platforms are **simple to use by design**. Almost everything has already
  been figured out before us. There is rarely a need to "reinvent the rocket."
- If a fix becomes bulky, multi-step, full of flags and workarounds — that is a **red flag**: the agent
  most likely didn't understand *how it actually works* and is fighting an imagined complexity, not the
  real task.
- Getting stuck is a signal NOT to "dig deeper into the complex," but to **stop and simplify the
  understanding**.

## Occam's Razor

**Do not multiply entities without necessity.** Of two solutions that explain/solve the same thing,
pick the one with fewer assumptions, less code, fewer moving parts.

In practice:

- Fewer states, flags, special cases, "crutches propping up crutches."
- If a solution needs five interlocking hacks — there is almost certainly one simple solution we
  failed to see because we misunderstood the task.
- A complex solution that "seems to work" is worse than a simple one that *demonstrably* works.

## KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid

**Simplicity is the goal, not a side effect.** The simplest solution that does the job is the correct
one. Add complexity only when it is objectively NECESSARY and proven — never "just in case."

In practice:

- First state the task in one or two plain sentences. If you can't, you don't understand it yet.
- Look for the built-in, out-of-the-box way in the library/platform *before* writing your own mechanism.
- If you're writing something clever, ask: "how would a simple person, or an off-the-shelf tool, do this?"

## The rule when stuck

1. **3 attempts** of "fix → build → test" without success = STOP. Stop poking blindly
   (see `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`).
2. Don't "dig harder" — **re-understand the task**: re-read what was actually asked, in plain words.
   The simple answer is often already there.
3. Run deep research (`/bug-research`): understand HOW it actually works (docs/source), don't guess.
   The goal is to find the SIMPLE, supported path.
4. Form a simple hypothesis and a simple plan. If the plan is complex again — you still don't
   understand the task.

## Illustration: the imagined-complexity trap

A typical failure mode: an agent receives a task it half-understands, picks a complicated mental model,
and then spends hours wrestling that model — trying flag after flag, inverting parameters, stacking
special cases — each attempt distorting the result a different way. This is fighting an *imagined*
problem.

The way out is never "try a sixth variation." It is to put the keyboard down and re-state the task in
one plain sentence — often a sentence the human can give you instantly. Nine times out of ten the plain
statement contains a simple, supported path that makes all the clever machinery unnecessary.

> The lesson: the task was simple. The agent invented a hard one, then got stuck in it.
> **Didn't understand → over-complicated → stuck.**

## The simplicity checklist (run before writing a complex solution)

- [ ] Can I explain the task in one plain sentence?
- [ ] Is there a built-in way in the library/platform? Did I look in the docs/source?
- [ ] Is my solution the minimum number of entities, or am I breeding flags and special cases?
- [ ] If the solution is complex — am I sure I understood the task, or am I fighting an imagined problem?
- [ ] What would an off-the-shelf tool / standard API do here?
- [ ] Have I already made ≥3 failed attempts? Then STOP → re-understand, don't escalate complexity.
- [ ] What would a resourceful human do? What ingenuity, creativity, or out-of-the-box thinking would help?
