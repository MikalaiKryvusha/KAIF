# <PROJECT_NAME> — Internal architecture map

> **The INTERNAL map: the project's logical architecture** — the abstraction objects the project's sphere
> works in, their essence, and how they interact. Where `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md` says *where
> things live*, this says *how the system thinks*. A fresh session reads this to understand the model, not
> just the file layout.
>
> **Adapt the abstractions to the sphere:**
> - *Programming* — modules, interfaces, objects, data structures, data flows, state, protocols.
> - *Science* — hypotheses, variables, models, datasets, methods, inference chains.
> - *Sociology* — subjects, objects, institutions, roles, the relations between them.
> - *Business* — actors, processes, value flows, resources, constraints.
> - …and so on for any sphere. If unsure, describe the domain's nouns and the verbs that connect them.
>
> **Living reference — never DONE-tagged.**

## The core abstractions

| Abstraction | What it *is* (essence) | Responsibility |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `<name>` | `<what concept it represents>` | `<what it owns / does>` |

## How they interact

`<Describe the interactions between the abstractions: who calls/produces/consumes/governs whom. A flow or
sequence in prose or a simple diagram. For software: data/control flow. For other spheres: the flow of
influence, information, or value.>`

```
<A> ──produces──▶ <B> ──consumed by──▶ <C>
```

## Invariants & rules of the model

`<The logical rules that must always hold — the "laws" of this architecture. Violating them is a bug even
if the code/text runs.>`

## Key decisions embedded in the architecture

`<Why the model is shaped this way — the trade-offs chosen. Ties back to MASTER_PLAN.md's decision log.>`

> Keep this in sync with the real logic as it evolves. When you introduce or retire an abstraction, or
> change how they interact, update this map in the same change. File/directory placement belongs in
> `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md`.
