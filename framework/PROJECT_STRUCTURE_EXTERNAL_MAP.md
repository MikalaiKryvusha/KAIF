# <PROJECT_NAME> — External structure map

> **The EXTERNAL map: what the project looks like from the outside** — its directories, files, and the
> cross-references and dependencies between them. This is the "where things live" map a fresh session
> reads to navigate. Its companion is `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md` (the *internal* logical
> architecture — the abstractions and how they interact).
>
> Adapt the vocabulary to the project's **sphere**: for software — directories, files, modules; for a
> research/writing/business project — sections, documents, datasets, artifacts. Keep it in sync with the
> real tree. **Living reference — never DONE-tagged.**

## The tree

```
<project root>/
├── <dir>/            # <what lives here>
│   └── <file>        # <role>
├── <file>            # <role>
└── ...
```

## What each part is

| Path | What it is | Depends on / references |
|------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `<path>` | `<one-line role>` | `<other paths it links to / relies on>` |

## Cross-references & dependency rules

`<The rules of who may reference/depend on whom — e.g. "docs link down, never up", "feature dirs don't
cross-reference each other", "generated files derive from sources in X". State the invariants so the agent
doesn't violate the structure.>`

## Entry points

`<Where a newcomer (human or agent) should start reading/looking, in order.>`

> Keep this map honest: when you add, move, or rename a file/directory, update the tree and the table in
> the same change. The *internal* logic (abstractions, data/interaction flows) belongs in
> `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md`.
