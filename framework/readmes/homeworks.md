# `homeworks/` — tasks from the agent to the human

Tasks the agent asks the **human** to do — things it cannot do itself because of its digital, bodyless
nature: test on real hardware, act in the physical world, use an account/credential only the human has,
make a purchase, observe something offline. Each doc describes the task with concrete steps for the human,
and collects the human's observations and results back. One `NN_<name>.md` each.

**For the human (owner):** when the agent files a homework, it needs a hand in the physical/offline world.
Follow the steps and write what you observed back into the document — the agent reads your notes and
continues.

**For the AI agent:** when you're blocked on something only a human-with-a-body can do, don't stall — write
a homework here with clear, minimal, numbered steps and a place for the human's results, then continue with
other work. When the human reports back, incorporate the results and `DONE`-tag the file
(`git mv NN_x.md NN_DONE_x.md`).
