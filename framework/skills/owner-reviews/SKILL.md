name: owner-reviews
description: Deploy the interactive review contour "agent ↔ owner" — everything the agent wants from the owner (forks, reviews, approvals, answers) rendered as local HTML pages with recorded one-click decisions, a send-side approval gate, signaling, and accumulation for autonomous loops. Optional sugar on top of the hard canon rule "the place of questions is interviews/" (AGENT_GUIDE.md). Use when the owner asks to move approvals to rendered pages ("render my interviews", "set up owner reviews", "сделай вычитку страницей") or when a project adopts the place-of-questions practice with tooling. KAIF fixes the methodology (what must hold); the project's agent builds the tools (how). Field-proven contour (Nogamelabs: "Мне нравится. Получилось удобно").

# /owner-reviews — the owner-review contour

The hard rule already stands in `AGENT_GUIDE.md`: everything the agent wants FROM the owner lives
ONLY in `interviews/` (or a named decision-queue document). This skill is the OPTIONAL contour on
top: interviews and outbound drafts rendered as local HTML, decisions recorded with author and
time, sends mechanically gated by approval. The field's main lesson goes first: **HTML is not the
goal but the transport; the goal is the GUARD** — the place-of-questions rule was broken by an
agent who knew it, and the guard found two questions nobody saw, hanging 5 and 13 days.

KAIF fixes NAMES and INVARIANTS; the implementation belongs to the project's agent. Zero external
dependencies is explicitly encouraged — the field contour is a ~100-line markdown mini-renderer, a
stdlib localhost server that lives seconds (serve → record → die), system utilities for
voice/sound/notification/browser; the page is self-contained and opens offline. The temptation to
take a static-site generator or UI framework is large and the win is zero.

## Build order (field-corrected: "ours was worse")

1. **The place-of-questions guard** — depends on nothing, pays immediately, shows the real scale.
2. **Render + decision record** — the core; the metadata contract lives here.
3. **The send-side gate** — makes approval mechanical; without it the page is decoration.
4. **Signaling** — useless before there is something to show.
5. **Accumulation for autonomous loops** — needed exactly when the practice enters day/night loops.
6. **Pilot on REAL data** — the only thing that catches seam defects.

**Acceptance criterion:** a full routine cycle passes **without a single clarification in chat**.
Not "the page opened" — "the owner approved and the agent never had to re-ask".

**Borrowing from a donor project.** When the owner points at a neighbor project as the model
("theirs came out better — study it"), the reading order is: **its bugs → its plan → its code**,
and the recon is not finished until its EXPERIENCE file and its upstream queue are read — what
the owner names aloud is what they noticed as a user; what their agent already SUFFERED lies in
the bug tracker, and skipping it means paying for the same defects again. Borrow the INTERFACE
and the lessons, never the files: a copy is a second truth with two places to fix.

## The invariants (normative — a contour without them falls apart)

One number space, I1–I36. I1–I7 are the original core; I8–I36 were each paid for by a field
incident in one of three projects running this contour (the tool ate an hour of the owner's work ·
a show replaced by a file path · an answered question re-asked two days later).

- **I1. md is the source, HTML is derived. Always.** The page is built from the document and never
  hand-edited — otherwise a second truth appears and the next empty-context session misses
  decisions.
- **I2. An answer is recorded in THREE places:** back into the source md (the next session reads
  the document) · `<doc>.decision.json` beside it (machine check before send) · a copy in the
  decisions archive with `by` and `at` (who decided, when). The decision filename is DERIVED from
  the document name — a shared decision file gets overwritten by the next interview. An answer the
  owner already wrote is NEVER overwritten: a new text arrives as a dated follow-up field, the
  original stays verbatim.
- **I3. Approval binds to the SHA-256 of the BODY, not to the click.** Text changed after approval
  = approval void, checked by machine. **And agree on normalization** — who strips what, at which
  step: the field's costliest defect was the page hashing file bytes while the sender hashed
  normalized text (trailing `\n` stripped); both self-tests green, the gate would refuse every
  artifact always. Only the end-to-end pilot on real data caught it.
- **I4. The gate stands on the SEND side, fail-closed.** The sending tool itself reads the
  decision, requires `approved` for THIS artifact, re-checks the hash — and refuses non-zero even
  under an explicit `--apply` when the decision is missing, `rejected`, or the text drifted. Any
  doubt = refusal. A request never self-approves by timeout.
- **I5. The signal follows a successfully opened page** — call the owner from the renderer, after
  the page is up; otherwise you get the class "summoned, nothing to show".
- **I6. Quiet hours override everything**, including an explicitly requested voice level:
  autoloop → quiet hours → setting. The window CROSSES MIDNIGHT (e.g. 23:00–09:00) — naive
  `from <= now <= to` is silent all day and loud all night; that comparison deserves its own guard.
- **I7. Autonomous loops accumulate, never block.** The queue is a STATE FILE — never move live
  documents into a pending folder (moving breaks every link to them from status and plans); one
  "N accumulated" page (each card linking to its document) calls the owner ONCE per batch. Paired
  with I8, the batch page must not live long: the owner answers one document, the contour closes
  and wakes the agent; if the queue still holds items, re-raising the batch is the agent's duty.

**The waiting-and-wake loop (I8–I14):**

- **I8. Saving wakes the waiter.** Field wording, vendored verbatim: *"The contour must WAKE the
  waiting agent on save. The agent learns of events by the TERMINATION of a process it started —
  therefore a long-lived server and a wake-up are mutually exclusive, and the wake-up wins. Any
  recorded decision terminates the contour; if anything remains unanswered, re-opening the page is
  the AGENT's duty, never the human's."* Every check before this one asserted the path TO the
  human; the path BACK is what the contour exists for.
- **I9. The machine's patience is infinite.** Waiting for a human's answer has NO timeout by
  default — the default is `0`, not "a big number" (a finite default gives the same defect, just
  rarer, and a rare defect is worse: it arrives when nobody expects it). A finite limit is an
  explicit flag for automation only, and it means tolerated SILENCE, never a deadline on thinking.
- **I10. Refusing the human's work must be LOUD.** Every network call that carries the human's
  work sits in try/catch. Mechanical test: "does a path exist where the save button stays disabled
  and no error status shows?" — if yes, that is a defect, not an edge case. A silent refusal is
  worse than a crash: a crash is seen at once, silence eats an hour.
- **I11. A rescue ring on the client.** Recording failed → the human's text comes back onto the
  page: a field with the full content, a Copy button, a Retry button, the save button re-enabled.
  The human's work has no right to exist only in the RAM of someone else's process.
- **I12. A draft in the browser.** `localStorage` on every input, restored on page load with a
  visible "picked up N fields" notice. Insurance never lives inside the thing it insures against —
  the server is exactly the part that dies.
- **I13. The receiver's pulse (page → server).** The page polls `/alive` (default every 15 s;
  10–60 s envelope) and says out loud the moment the server goes silent — the human learns of the
  trouble immediately, not after an hour at the click. The one measure that makes the
  ate-the-work defect impossible rather than fixable.
- **I14. The reverse pulse (server ← page).** Closing the page is an EVENT for the server. Two
  channels: a `sendBeacon('/closed')` on `pagehide` (fast path; wait ~3 s to tell a reload from a
  close) plus a silence watch (threshold with a large margin, ~3 min, against background-tab
  throttling; two strikes against machine sleep). Infinite patience (I9) is right only while the
  addressee is alive — if a contour can notice its partner's death in one direction, it must
  notice it in the other.

**Antagonists — read as ONE block.** I8 (the process dies ON EVENT) ↔ I9 (never BY CLOCK) ↔ I14
(patience lasts while the page lives). The forbidden reading is named: *"since the process must
die anyway, let it also die on a timer"* — that false symmetry is exactly what the field paid for.

**Showing (I15–I17; the canon lives in `AGENT_GUIDE.md`, the contour enforces it):**

- **I15. Showing is an action, not a link.** Whatever the agent wants the human to perceive, the
  agent OPENS ITSELF; "lies at path…", "opens by double-click", "see file X" addressed to the
  human are banned as a way of showing. The path is a footnote AFTER the show, never an errand.
- **I16. The show contour = the question contour.** The page opens ANY markdown, not only
  documents with questions; the document-wide comment field lets the human answer or stay silent.
  No separate show tool is ever built.
- **I17. A mechanical check on showing.** Grep the agent's own reply for "double-click", "opens
  offline", "see file", "lies at" next to an artifact extension — a hit means the show was
  replaced by a link. The rule holds through an executable command in rituals, not through intent.

**Answer propagation — the return leg (I18–I21; procedure in `/interview`):**

- **I18. A question declares its ANSWER TARGET, written together with the question.** The agent
  knows which line of which document is blocked exactly at asking time — that knowledge is the
  reason to ask; the field is cheaper than any memory.
- **I19. Closing an interview is PROPAGATION, not a status flip.** Every declared target cites
  "interview #NNN, QN" and is brought in line with the answer — including REMOVING what the answer
  cancelled (a stale risk or phase order left alive keeps steering the plan). The status change is
  the LAST action. Cap on form: one citation in the blocked document — not a traceability table,
  not a separate register.
- **I20. The return-leg guard.** For every ANSWERED question, check that its declared targets cite
  it. Inherited debt goes into a baseline (key: `file + sha1(text)`), red fires only on NEW items,
  the debt count prints on every run and must go down. The summary reports BOTH legs — a one-leg
  "0 waiting" is a false green; the unit is the QUESTION, never the interview file.
- **I21. Old interviews without the target field get a heuristic, not a refusal:** at least one
  citation anywhere outside `interviews/`. Zero migration; history is not rewritten.

**Provenance (I22–I24):**

- **I22. Provenance has TWO representations:** machine (ISO, for the archive and programs) and
  human (local time in words, next to the answer and on the question card). One never replaces the
  other.
- **I23. Time shown to a human is always LOCAL.** UTC in the interface is a lie about the human's
  own action.
- **I24. The markdown renderer strips HTML comments.** Escaping foreign markup and displaying
  service comments are different things; inside fenced code, comments stay (there they are
  content). Fix it in the renderer — one node covers all present and future markers.

**Window, port, outcomes, process (I25–I31):**

- **I25. There are exactly three outcomes, all visible in the process log:** decision recorded ·
  page closed without an answer · interrupted by the human. "He's probably still thinking" is not
  an outcome.
- **I26. A separate app window (`--app=`), never a tab** in the human's working browser window —
  both the owner's explicit ask and a technical truth: auto-close is only possible in a window the
  script itself opened.
- **I27. Auto-close is an ATTEMPT, not a promise:** ~2 s after the answer is recorded; if the
  browser refuses, the page honestly says "please close me" — never a silent "hangs as it was".
- **I28. The voice call by name is the DEFAULT level,** not an option for the brave: a voice built
  but switched off by a setting exists only on paper.
- **I29. One document — one window.** A lock with pid and address; a second launch prints the live
  address and exits. Two windows are two calls AND two different drafts — the port is part of the
  web origin, so a draft written in one window is invisible to the other.
- **I30. A free port (`listen(0)`), never a fixed one.** On a fixed port a live old server
  silently wins the race, `curl` returns 200, and the human reads a STALE page; the `pkill`
  temptation (which kills the page open in front of the human) disappears with it.
- **I31. Process termination is the answer-delivery channel.** The agent starts the contour as a
  TRACKED background task and subscribes to its termination; a bare `&` is not tracked by the
  harness and no notification ever comes.

**The call (I32–I36):**

- **I32. The call never blocks the contour.** Speech synthesis takes seconds; a synchronous call
  steals them from the page server — the human stares at an empty window instead of questions.
- **I33. Chain order matters: instant sound → banner → voice.** A parallel launch lays the beep
  over the speech. Default beeps: 880 Hz/160 ms → 660/160 → 990/260, then the voice.
- **I34. The sound path must not depend on user OS settings.** Native notifications get muted
  silently with a success exit code; the beep goes through the sound card; delivery is confirmed
  WITH THE HUMAN, never by exit code.
- **I35. The voice falls back honestly to the system one.** No engine on this machine (other box,
  removed venv) — the approval contour has no right to break over timbre; make route choice a pure
  function so both branches sit under guards regardless of the machine running the checks.
- **I36. Text normalization for speech lives in the ENGINE, not in the project.** The call phrase
  almost always carries a number ("interview #16"); without normalization digits get swallowed or
  spelled out. Heavy shared resources (the TTS model, its venv) belong to the MACHINE, not the
  project: the project calls a ready command and falls back honestly when it is absent.

## The named class: "handling the human's work"

Every defect the owner catches personally is a defect of handling their TIME and WORK, not of
rendering — and none of them is found by any mechanical self-check. The class is therefore
verified BY ROSTER, walking the field-paid cases one by one, not by self-tests: no-timeout
waiting (I9) · loud refusal (I10) · rescue ring (I11) · browser draft (I12) · both pulses
(I13/I14) · app window, not a tab (I26) · auto-close attempt (I27) · voice by default (I28) ·
project name in the header (page element P9). Accepting a contour = walking this roster.

## Page elements by name (P1–P9) — one style across projects

- **P1** — question widget with a 4–5 px state stripe on the left edge; the stripe's color IS the
  state (waiting / answered): one detail carries two meanings — separates and informs.
- **P2** — explicit state tags on every question: answered / unanswered / awaits you.
- **P3** — selection clearable by a second click (a native radio cannot return to "none"): state
  remembered on `mousedown` (before browser activation), cleared on the field's own click,
  label-target events skipped — otherwise a text click clears twice, i.e. never.
- **P4** — no "who answers" question on a one-owner project; the server still stamps `by` —
  remove the QUESTION, not the RECORD, or the archive is unreadable months later.
- **P5** — both OS themes via `prefers-color-scheme`, colors as variables, contrast measured in
  pixels from day one.
- **P6** — embedded media: `data:` URIs for audio and images, `srcdoc` iframes for live mockups (a
  `file://` link from an http page is blocked — embedding is the only working path). A choice
  among four mockups opens as a SEPARATE window (opened by script → closable by script); the
  inline frame is for quick previews of smaller decisions.
- **P7** — a comment field per question AND a document-wide comment at the bottom; the latter is a
  legitimate review outcome on its own ("no answers, but something to say"), appended as a dated
  block — comments accumulate, never overwrite.
- **P8** — a markdown mini-renderer (~120 lines), zero dependencies, escaping as the FIRST action.
- **P9** — the project name in the page header: the owner runs several projects, and the document
  title alone does not say WHO is asking.

## The name contract (candidate, field-tested on four product routines)

Metadata block in the document head (fenced YAML): `title` · `kind` (interview / outbound draft /
…) · `artifacts:` list of approvable bodies, each `{id, target ("Slack · #channel"), format,
body_file}`. **`body_file` is a LINK, not a copy-paste** — the page shows exactly the bytes that
will leave, and the hash is computed over them; a pasted copy is a second truth and breaks I3.
Decision record: `kind, document, by, at, comment` + `artifacts: {<id>: {status, sha256}}` for
drafts / `answers: {Q1: {choice, text, comment}}` for interviews. `by` is not decoration — it is
what makes the archive readable months later.

## Rakes to warn about (in falling price order)

1. Hash without a normalization agreement → the gate refuses always, on green self-tests (I3).
2. **Tool built, agent not using it** — the same day the page worked, the agent retold questions
   in chat: chat is cheaper in the moment. A tool counts as ADOPTED only when a ritual carries the
   executable command that shows violations ("show ALL unanswered interviews on one page").
3. **Exit 0 ≠ the human got the signal** — native notifications get muted silently by OS focus
   settings with a success code. A must-arrive signal needs a path independent of user settings,
   and delivery is confirmed WITH THE HUMAN, not by exit code.
4. **Fixtures don't catch live documents** — three renderer defects surfaced only on the project's
   real files. A run over ALL existing live documents is a handover condition for the tool.
5. **A principle, not a tip: a false alarm in a guard is worse than a miss** — it teaches ignoring
   the tool, and it is violated most eagerly exactly while building guards; close each with its
   own guard. Expect ~10 false hits per real one for a text-rule guard; exceptions are explicit,
   with the reason on the line. Guess-heuristics ("option letters must run A, B, C") don't go into
   guards — precision is held by a frozen etalon, not by plausibility.
6. **Both OS themes** — dark-on-dark code blocks were caught by the owner, not by self-checks.
7. **Non-ASCII regexes:** in Node `\w`/`\b` are ASCII-only even with `u` — use `\p{L}` /
   `(?!\p{L})` with the `u` flag, or the guard silently misses its own language.

## Parameters and compatibility

- Sound/TTS are PARAMETERS: the voice name is a parameter, not a menu (a field machine had exactly
  one usable voice out of 185); quiet hours are mandatory, not optional.
- Industrial four on the page: **Approve / Reject-with-reason / Edit / Respond**; the payload is
  visible in full; the audit trail keeps refusals too.
- An answer's force never depends on transport: **HTML = md = chat** — all are the owner's word,
  recorded with `by`/`at` (equivalence rule, `/interview`).
- Interviews without the contour keep working exactly as before — the sugar never becomes a duty.
