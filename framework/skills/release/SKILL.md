description: Build a release candidate and publish it to GitHub Releases — pre-check, refresh README (and bilingual copies), regenerate rendered docs, version bump + build + tag + push + GitHub Release. Use when the human says "make a release", "ship a release", "cut an RC", "publish a new version", "release", "ship it", "сделай релиз", "выпусти релиз".

# /release — publish a release to GitHub

The human asks to ship a new version. This is an **irreversible external action** (a public tag +
GitHub Release). Run the routine **in order**; narrate each step in the chat. If a step fails — stop,
show the error, do NOT continue blindly.

> ⚠️ **CONFIRMATION REQUIRED.** Before the publish itself, show the human: which version it'll be
> (current → new), that the tree is clean, that it built. Publish only on their explicit "yes". A release
> = a public tag and Release, unpleasant to roll back. **In autonomous mode (`/autoloop`/loops) do NOT
> publish a release.**

## Step 0. Decide the bump type

Confirm with the human (or confirm the default): patch / minor / major. State the current → new version.

## Step 1. Pre-check the environment (don't release on a dirty/broken tree)

```bash
git status --short          # tree must be CLEAN (except gitignored artifacts)
git branch --show-current   # the release branch (e.g. main)
git pull --rebase           # so the push is fast-forward
gh auth status              # gh logged in (needed for the GitHub Release)
```
If the tree is dirty — commit/sort it out first (`/pause` or your commit tool).

## Step 2. Refresh README (all languages)

Bring `README.md` in line with reality: phase status, working features, instructions. If bilingual, keep
both languages in sync. Don't invent — reflect only what's actually done and verified (cross-check
`STATUS.md` and the closed `bugs/`/`plans/ideas/` `*_DONE_*`).

## Step 3. Regenerate rendered docs

`<Regenerate any rendered artifacts, e.g. README.pdf (node tools/readme-pdf.mjs). For this framework's
own project, also regenerate the self-extracting core: node tools/build-framework.mjs.>`

## Step 4. Control build (before the release)

`<Run the project build (BUILD_COMMAND). It must succeed. This catches errors BEFORE the version bump so
you don't leave a half-released version.>`

## Step 5. Commit the doc/build changes (before the release)

Commit the README/docs updates so the `release: X.Y` commit is a clean version bump:
```bash
<COMMIT_COMMAND> "docs: README for release X.Y"
```

## Step 6. Publish (after the human's confirmation)

`<Run your release flow. If you have a release tool (e.g. tools/release.mjs that bumps the version,
builds, renames the artifact, commits "release: X.Y", tags vX.Y, pushes, and runs gh release create with
auto-notes), run it. Otherwise, do it explicitly:>`
```bash
# bump version (in version.json or your manifest), then:
git commit -am "release: X.Y" && git tag vX.Y && git push && git push --tags
gh release create vX.Y --title "vX.Y" --generate-notes <ARTIFACT(S) if any>
```

## Step 7. Verify and report

```bash
gh release view vX.Y        # the release exists, artifacts attached
git log --oneline -3        # the release commit + tag are visible
```
Report to the human: the version, the release link, what was attached. Done.

## Notes
- Releases bump minor/major; ordinary in-progress commits bump the build/patch.
- If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward) — `git pull --rebase` and retry. On step 6 this is critical:
  a tag may already exist locally — check `git tag` and `git tag -d vX.Y` before retrying.
- NEVER force-push and never delete others' tags/releases. If something goes wrong during publish — stop
  and show the human, don't "fix" it blindly.
- Don't release in autonomous mode — only on the human's explicit request.
