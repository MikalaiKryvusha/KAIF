description: Resume work where the last session left off — read the key project documents, decide the single most important thing to do now, announce it, and start. Use when the human says "continue", "let's continue", "what's next", "where did we leave off", "resume", "pick up where we left off", "продолжи", "продолжим", "что дальше".

# /resume — pick up where we left off

A new session starts with empty context. This skill rebuilds the picture fast and gets to work.

## Step 1. Read the key documents (all in parallel)

Read at once:

- `STATUS.md` — current state, what's in progress, the "where to continue" checklist
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` — the long-term plan and phases
- `AGENT_GUIDE.md` — the rules for working on this project (mandatory)
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md` — architecture: modules, files, data flow

If relevant to open questions:
- `bugs/` — `ls bugs/`, open the non-`DONE` bugs
- `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` — if a bug fix is likely
- `PHILOSOPHY.md` — the simplicity principle

## Step 2. Synthesize — choose the one main thing

Pick a single direction for this session. Priority (descending):

1. **Open bugs with real symptoms** — if `STATUS.md` lists an open bug with reproducible symptoms, it's
   priority #1. Work by `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`.
2. **Next item from the `STATUS.md` "where to continue" checklist** — if bugs are clear.
3. **Next phase from `MASTER_PLAN.md`** — if the checklist is empty/done.

Before starting, **tell the human in one paragraph**: what you read and the current status; what you
picked as the main thing and why; what you're about to do right now.

Wait for confirmation only if the task is **destructive** or **large and non-obvious**. If the plan is
clear — start right after the short announcement.

## Step 3. Work

Do the chosen task. Along the way:
- Write short updates in the chat (what you're doing, what you found, where you're digging).
- Follow `AGENT_GUIDE.md` (code style, the bug framework, the test harness).
- If it's a bug — keep a log in the relevant `bugs/` file.

## Notes

- Verify the environment before relying on it (build toolchain, devices, services) — see `AGENT_GUIDE.md`.
- Don't re-derive what the docs already state; trust `STATUS.md` and the plans, then verify by doing.
